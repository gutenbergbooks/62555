<p><span class="smcap">The</span> writings of Vladimir Korolenko have been
likened to &#8220;a fresh breeze blowing through the heavy
air of a hospital.&#8221; The hospital is the pessimistic
literature of the modern Russian intellectuals; the
fresh breeze is the voice of the simple-hearted children
of &#8220;Mother Russia.&#8221; These are for the most
part tillers of the soil and conquerors of waste
places; peasants, pioneers, and Siberian exiles; they
often belong to the great class of &#8220;the insulted and
the injured&#8221;: they suffer untold hardships, but their
heads are unbowed and their hearts are full of courage
and the desire for justice. Among them the
great writer&#8217;s early life was spent.</p>

<p>Vladimir Korolenko was born on June 15th, 1853,
in Zhitomir, a small town in Southwestern or Little
Russia. On his father&#8217;s side he came of an old Cossack
family, his mother was the daughter of a Polish
landowner of Zhitomir. The boy&#8217;s early life was
spent amidst picturesque surroundings; he grew
up among the Poles, Jews, and light-hearted, dark-eyed
peasants that make up the population of Little
Russia, and he never lost the poetic love of nature
and the wholesome sense of humour that were nurtured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
in him under those warm, bright skies. In his
story entitled &#8220;In Bad Company&#8221; he has vividly described
the romantic little town that was the home of
his childhood. The stern but just judge of that tale
is more or less the prototype of his own father. The
elder Korolenko was distinguished for an impeccable
honesty of practice rare in an official of those times;
consequently, when he died in 1870, he left his widow
and five children without the slightest means of support.
Thanks, however, to the energy of his heroic
mother, Vladimir was enabled at seventeen to enter
the School of Technology in Petrograd.</p>

<p>Then followed three years of struggle to combine
his schooling with the necessity for earning a living,
during which Korolenko himself says that he does
not know how he managed to escape starvation.
Even a cheap dinner of eighteen copecks or nine
cents was such a luxury to him in those days that
he only treated himself to it six or seven times during
the course of one whole year.</p>

<p>In 1874 the young student went to Moscow with
ten hard-earned roubles in his pocket and entered
the Petrovski Academy, but he was soon expelled
from that seat of learning for presenting a petition
from his fellow-students to the Director of the College.
He returned to Petrograd where his family
were now living, and he and his brother made a desperate
attempt to support themselves and their
brothers and sisters by proof-reading. The future<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
author began sending articles to the newspapers and
magazines, and it was then that occurred the first of
the series of arrests to which he was subjected for
what were considered his advanced social doctrines.
He was sent first to Kronstadt for a year and then
to Viatka; thence he travelled to Perm, and from
Perm to Tomsk; at last he was finally exiled to the
distant eastern Siberian province of Yakutsk.</p>

<p>There he spent nearly six years, the most valuable,
to him, of his whole life. The vast forest that clothes
those far northeastern marshes, grand, gloomy, and
held forever in the grip of a deadly cold, made an
indelible impression on the imagination of the young
artist. He was profoundly moved by the sorrows
of the half-savage pioneers inhabiting its trackless
solitudes, by the indomitable spirit of his fellow-exiles,
and by the adventurous life of the &#8220;brodiagi&#8221;
or wanderers, convicts escaped from prison who return
secretly on foot to their &#8220;Mother Russia&#8221;
across the whole breadth of the Siberian continent.</p>

<p>Korolenko was released from exile in 1885, and
immediately on his return to Russia published his
beautiful &#8220;Makar&#8217;s Dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>The success of the story was immediate, the fame
of the author was at once assured. No politics, no
social doctrines were here; the appeal of Makar&#8217;s
plea was universal; liberal and conservative critics
alike united in a chorus of praise. The Russian
reading public was charmed by the originality of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
subject, the radiant conciseness of the author&#8217;s style,
and the lyric beauty of the story&#8217;s end which illuminates
with deep significance every detail that has
gone before. Poor Makar, most lonely dweller in
the Siberian forest, leading a life of incredible labour
and hardship, finally dies, and for his sins is
condemned at the Judgment of the Great Toyon, or
Chief, to suffer in the life hereafter sorrows and toil
more grievous than any he has known on earth. Here
is the type of &#8220;the insulted and the injured&#8221; beloved
of Dostoievsky and Tolstoi, but with one supreme
difference: Makar does not suffer misfortune in passive
dejection, he protests. He protests indignantly
against the injustice of the judgment of the Great
Toyon. Life for him has been desperately hard; it
is unjust to judge him by the standards set for the
righteous whom the Toyon loves, &#8220;whose faces are
bathed in perfume and whose garments are sewn by
other hands than their own.&#8221; This protest, combined
with a warm love for all humanity, was to become
the keynote of Korolenko&#8217;s writings.</p>

<p>His next story, &#8220;In Bad Company,&#8221; appeared in
the same year, and added still more to the young
author&#8217;s popularity. It is a general favourite in
Russia to this day. Though its style is slightly
tainted with a flowery Polish exuberance, the descriptions
of the old feudal ruins are full of poetry,
the children are drawn with sympathy and insight,
and the vagabond Turkevich, in his tragi-comic r&ocirc;le<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
of the Prophet Jeremiah, sounds an unmistakable
note of protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Murmuring Forest&#8221; was published in 1886,
and is a darkly romantic tale of the dreaming pine
forests of Southern Russia, written in the style of
an ancient legend. Here the protest of the Cossack
Opanas and the forester Raman is blind and rude
and brings death to their highborn oppressor, but
the plot is laid in feudal times and the need of the
serfs was great. The voice of the wind in the tree-tops
dominates the unfolding of the simple story like
a resonant chord, and when at last fierce justice is
done to the tyrant Count, its advent seems as inevitable
as the breaking of the thunder-storm that,
during the whole course of the tale, has been brewing
over the forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Day of Atonement&#8221; is one of Korolenko&#8217;s
lightest and gayest stories. In describing the merry
life of the South, the Little Russian&#8217;s kindly humour
joins hands with his glowing imagination, and we
have a vivid glimpse of a cosy village surrounded by
cherry gardens and bathed in warm moonlight; of
black-eyed girls, of timid, bustling Jews, of superstitious
townsmen, of a canny miller; in short, of all
the busy, active life of a town within the Jewish Pale.</p>

<p>But grave or gay, merry or sad, Korolenko is
above all things an optimist in his outlook on the
world. Through thick and thin, through sorrow and
misfortune, the poor, artless heroes of his stories all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
turn their faces towards the light. The writer&#8217;s kind
heart never ceases its search for the &#8220;eternally human&#8221;
in every man, and deeply does he sympathise
with mankind&#8217;s unquenchable desire for freedom and
justice, which can face evil unafraid. He himself
has said in a letter to a friend: &#8220;The Universe
is not the sport of accidental forces. Determinism,
Evolution, and all other theories lead one to confess
that there is a law which is drawing us toward something;
toward something which we call &#8216;good&#8217; in all
its manifestations, that is to say toward kindness,
truth, right, beauty, and justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>That is the burden of Korolenko&#8217;s message to the
world, embodied in all his writings.</p>

<p>On his return from Siberia, Korolenko went to live
in Nijni-Novgorod and there took an active part in
bettering the conditions of life among &#8220;the insulted
and the injured&#8221; whom he loved. In a year of famine
he worked hard to organise free kitchens for the
starving poor, and many energetic articles from
his pen were published in the papers. He also continued
to produce stories, sketches, and several
longer novels, of which the best known is the &#8220;Blind
Musician.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1894 he made a journey to England and
America, and on his return wrote an amusing record
of his travels entitled: &#8220;Without a Tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1895 he became the editor of the magazine,
<i>Russkoye Bogatsvo</i>, and since that date the great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
story writer has definitely devoted himself to journalism,
and has now become one of Russia&#8217;s greatest
publicists.</p>

<p>The Russian heart is essentially charitable and
full of human kindness. Thoroughly democratic in
their relations with one another, the Russian people
have the misfortune to labour under the harshest
political r&eacute;gime in Europe. Like many of his
countrymen, Korolenko now devotes his life to
the cause of the suffering and the downtrodden, and
to helping those who are the victims of social and
political injustice.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">A CHRISTMAS STORY</p>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> dream was dreamed by poor Makar, who herded
his calves in a stern and distant land, by that same
Makar upon whose head all troubles are said to
fall.</p>

<p>Makar&#8217;s birth place was the lonely village of Chalgan,
lost in the far forests of Yakutsk. His parents
and grandparents had wrested a strip of land from
the forest, and their courage had not failed even
when the dark thickets still stood about them like
a hostile wall. Rail fences began to stretch across
the clearing; small, smoky huts began to crowd
thickly upon it; hay and straw stacks sprang up;
and at last, from a knoll in the centre of the encampment,
a church spire had shot toward heaven
like a banner of victory.</p>

<p>Chalgan had become a village.</p>

<p>But while Makar&#8217;s forbears had been striving with
the forest, burning it with fire and hewing it with
steel, they themselves had slowly become savage
in their turn. They married Yakut women, spoke
the language of the Yakuts, adopted their customs,
and gradually in them the characteristics of the
Great Russian race had been obliterated and lost.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, my Makar firmly believed that he
was a Russian peasant of Chalgan, and not a nomad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
Yakut. In Chalgan he had been born, there he had
lived and there he meant to die. He was very proud
of his birth and station, and when he wished to
vilify his fellow-townsmen would call them &#8220;heathen
Yakuts,&#8221; though if the truth must be told, he differed
from them neither in habits nor manner of
living. He seldom spoke Russian and, when he did,
spoke it badly. He dressed in skins, wore &#8220;torbas&#8221;
on his feet, ate dough-cakes and drank brick-tea,
supplemented on holidays and special occasions with
as much cooked butter as happened to be on the
table before him. He could ride very skilfully on an
ox, and when he fell ill he always summoned a wizard,
who would go mad and spring at him, gnashing his
teeth, hoping to frighten the malady out of his patient
and so drive it away.</p>

<p>Makar worked desperately hard, lived in poverty,
and suffered from hunger and cold. Had he a
thought beyond his unceasing anxiety to obtain his
dough-cakes and brick-tea? Yes, he had.</p>

<p>When he was drunk, he would weep and cry: &#8220;Oh,
Lord my God, what a life!&#8221; sometimes adding that
he would like to give it all up and go up on to the
&#8220;mountain.&#8221; There he need neither sow nor reap,
nor cut and haul wood, nor even grind grain on a
hand millstone. He would &#8220;be saved,&#8221; that was all.
He did not know exactly where the mountain was,
nor what it was like, he only knew that there was
such a place, and that it was somewhere far away,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
so far that there not even the District Policeman
could find him. Of course there he would pay no
taxes.</p>

<p>When sober he abandoned these thoughts, realising
perchance the impossibility of finding that beautiful
mountain, but when drunk he grew bolder. Admitting
that he might not find that particular mountain,
but some other, he would say: &#8220;In that case I
should die.&#8221; But he was prepared to start, nevertheless.
If he did not carry out his intention, it was
because the Tartars in the village always sold him
vile vodka with an infusion of mahorka<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> for
strength, and this quickly made him ill and laid him
by the heels.</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve, and Makar knew that to-morrow
would be a great holiday. This being the
case, he was overpowered with a longing for drink,
but to drink there was nothing. His resources were
at an end. His flour was all gone, he was already
in debt to the village merchants and Tartars, yet
to-morrow was a great holiday, he would not be
able to work, what could he do if he did not get
drunk? This reflection made him unhappy. What a
life it was! He had not even one bottle of vodka to
drink on the great winter holiday.</p>

<p>Then a happy thought came to him. He got up
and put on his ragged fur coat. His wife, a sturdy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
sinewy woman, remarkably strong and equally remarkably
ugly, who saw through all his simple wiles,
guessed his intentions as usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going, you wretch? To drink
vodka alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet. I&#8217;m going to buy one bottle. We&#8217;ll
drink it together to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave her a sly wink and clapped her on the
shoulder with such force that she staggered. A
woman&#8217;s heart is like that; though she knew that
Makar was deceiving her, she surrendered to the
charms of that conjugal caress.</p>

<p>He went out of the house, caught his old piebald
pony in the courtyard, led him by the mane to the
sleigh, and put him in harness. The piebald soon
carried Makar through the gates and then stopped
and looked enquiringly at his Master, who was sitting
plunged in thought. At this Makar pulled the
left rein, and drove away to the outskirts of the
village.</p>

<p>On the edge of the village stood a little hut out
of which, as out of the other huts, the smoke of a
little fire rose high, high into the air, veiling the
bright moon and the white, glittering hosts of stars.
The flames crackled merrily and sparkled through
the dim icicles that hung about the doorway. All
was quiet inside the courtyard gates.</p>

<p>Strangers from a foreign land lived here. How
they had come, what tempest had cast them up in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
that lonely clearing, Makar knew not, neither cared
to know, but he liked to trade with them, for they
neither pressed him too hard nor insisted upon payment.</p>

<p>On entering the hut, Makar went straight to the
fireplace and stretched out his frozen hands over the
blaze, crying &#8220;Tcha&#8221; to explain how the frost had
nipped him.</p>

<p>The foreigners were at home; a candle was burning
on the table although no work was being done.
One man was lying on the bed blowing rings of
smoke, pensively following their winding curves with
his eyes, and intertwining with them the long threads
of his thoughts.</p>

<p>The other was sitting over the fire thoughtfully
watching the sparks that crept across the burning
wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Makar, to break the oppressive silence.</p>

<p>He did not know&mdash;how should he&mdash;the sadness that
filled the hearts of the two strangers, the memories
that crowded their brains that evening, the visions
they saw in the fantastic play of fire and smoke. Besides,
he had troubles of his own.</p>

<p>The young man who sat by the chimney raised
his head and looked at Makar with puzzled eyes, as
if not recognising him. Then, with a shake of his
head, he quickly got up from his chair.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>&#8220;Ah, good evening, good evening, Makar. Good.
Will you have tea with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tea?&#8221; Makar repeated after him. &#8220;That&#8217;s good.
That&#8217;s good, brother; that&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began quickly to take off his things. Once
free of his fur coat and cap he felt more at his
ease, and, seeing the red coals already glowing in the
samovar, he turned to the young man with exaggerated
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like you, that is the truth. I like you so, so
very much; at night I don&#8217;t sleep&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger turned, and a bitter smile crept over
his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You like me, do you?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;What do you
want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Business,&#8221; Makar answered. &#8220;But how did you
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. When I&#8217;ve had tea I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>As his hosts themselves had offered him tea, Makar
thought the moment opportune to press the point
farther.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any roast meat?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, never mind,&#8221; replied Makar soothingly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have that some other time, won&#8217;t we?&#8221; And
he repeated his question: &#8220;We&#8217;ll have that some
other time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Makar now considered that the strangers owed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
him a piece of roast meat, and he never failed to
collect a debt of this kind.</p>

<p>Another hour found him seated once more in his
sled, having made one whole rouble by selling five
loads of wood in advance on fairly good terms.
Now, although he had vowed and sworn not to drink
up the money until to-morrow, he nevertheless made
up his mind to do so without delay. What odds?
The pleasure ahead silenced the voice of his conscience;
he even forgot the cruel drubbing in store
for his drunken self from his wife, the faithful and
the deceived.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going, Makar?&#8221; called the
stranger laughing, as Makar&#8217;s horse, instead of
going straight ahead, turned off to the left in the
direction of the Tartar settlement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa! Whoa! Will you look where the brute
is going?&#8221; cried Makar to exculpate himself, tugging
hard at the left rein nevertheless and slyly slapping
his pony&#8217;s side with the right.</p>

<p>The clever little horse stumbled patiently away in
the direction required by his master, and the scraping
of the runners soon stopped in front of a Tartar
house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the gate stood several horses with high-peaked
Yakut saddles on their backs.</p>

<p>The air in the crowded hut was stifling and hot;
a dense cloud of acrid mahorka smoke hung in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
air and wound slowly up the chimney. Yakut visitors
were sitting on benches about the room or had
clustered around the tables set with mugs full of
vodka. Here and there little groups were gathered
over a game of cards. The faces of all were flushed
and shining with sweat. The eyes of the gamblers
were fiercely intent on their play, and the money
came and went in a flash from pocket to pocket.
On a pile of straw in a corner sat a drunken Yakut,
rocking his body to and fro and droning an endless
song. He drew the wild, rasping sounds from his
throat in every possible key, repeating always that
to-morrow was a great holiday and that to-day he
was drunk.</p>

<p>Makar paid his rouble and received in return a
bottle of vodka. He slipped it into the breast of his
coat and retired unnoticed into a corner. There he
filled mug after mug in rapid succession and gulped
them down one after another. The liquor was vile,
diluted for the holiday with more than three quarters
of water, but if the dole of vodka was scant, the
mahorka had not been stinted. Makar caught his
breath after each draught, and purple spots circled
before his eyes.</p>

<p>The liquor soon overpowered him; he also sank
down on the straw, folded his arms around his knees,
and laid his heavy head upon them. The same
dreary, rasping sounds burst of their own accord
from his throat; he sang that to-morrow was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
great holiday and that he had drunk up five loads
of wood.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the hut was filling with other Yakuts
who had come to town to go to church and to drink
Tartar vodka, and the host saw that soon there
would be no room for more. He rose from the table
and looked at the company, and, as he did so, his eye
fell upon Makar and the Yakut sitting in their dark
corner. He made his way to the Yakut, seized him
by the coat collar, and flung him out of the hut.
Then he approached Makar.</p>

<p>As a citizen of Chalgan, the Tartar showed him
greater respect; he threw the door open wide and
gave the poor fellow such a kick from behind that
Makar shot out of the hut and buried his nose in a
snow-drift.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to say whether Makar was
offended by this treatment or not. He felt snow up
his sleeves and on his face, picked himself up somehow
out of the drift, and staggered to where his
piebald was standing.</p>

<p>The moon had by now risen high in the heavens
and the tail of the Great Bear was dipping toward
the horizon. The cold was tightening its grasp.
The first fiery shafts of the Aurora were flaring up
fitfully out of a dark, semicircular cloud in the north
and playing softly across the sky.</p>

<p>The piebald, realising, it seemed, his master&#8217;s condition,
trudged carefully and soberly homeward.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
Makar sat in his sled, swaying from side to side, and
continued his song. He sang that he had drunk away
five loads of wood, and that his old woman would
kill him when he got home.</p>

<p>The sounds that burst from his throat rasped and
groaned so dismally through the evening air that his
friend the foreigner, who had climbed up on to his
roof to close the mouth of the chimney, felt more than
ever unhappy at the sound of Makar&#8217;s song.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the piebald had drawn the sled to the
top of a little hill from where the surrounding country
could be distinctly seen. The snowy expanse
lay shining brightly, bathed in the rays of the moon,
but from time to time the moonlight faded and the
white fields grew dark until, with a sudden flash, the
radiance of the Northern Lights streamed across
them. Then it seemed as if the snowy hills and the
forest that clothed them were coming very close, to
withdraw once again into the distant shadow. Makar
spied plainly through the trees the silvery bald
crown of the little knoll behind which his traps were
waiting for all the wild dwellers of the forest. The
sight of this hill changed the tenor of his thoughts.
He sang that a fox had been caught in one of his
snares; he would sell the pelt in the morning, and so
his wife would not kill him.</p>

<p>The first chimes of the church bells were ringing
through the frosty air as Makar re-entered his hut.
His first words were to tell his wife that a fox had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
been caught in one of his traps, and as he had forgotten
entirely that the old woman had not shared
his vodka, he was violently surprised when she gave
him a cruel kick, without paying any attention to
his good news.</p>

<p>Later, as he lay prostrate on the bed, she managed
to give him another blow in the back with her fist.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the solemn, festal chiming of the bells
broke over Chalgan and floated far, far away into
the distance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He lay on his bed with his head burning and his
vitals on fire. The strong mixture of vodka and
mahorka was coursing through his veins, and trickles
of melted snow were running down his face and back.</p>

<p>His wife thought him asleep, but he was not
sleeping. He could not get the idea of that fox out
of his head. He had succeeded in convincing himself
absolutely that a fox had been caught in one of
his traps, and he even knew which trap it was. He
saw the fox pinned under the heavy log, saw it tearing
at the snow with its claws and struggling to be
free, while the moonbeams stole into the thicket and
played over its red-gold fur. The eyes of the wild
creature were glowing at his approach.</p>

<p>He could stand it no longer. He rose from his
bed, and started to find his faithful pony who was to
carry him into the forest.</p>

<p>But what was this? Had the strong arms of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
wife really seized him by the collar of his fur coat
and thrown him back on the bed?</p>

<p>No, here he was, already beyond the village. The
runners of his sleigh were creaking smoothly over
the hard snow. Chalgan had been left behind. The
solemn tones of the church bells came floating along
his trail, and on the black line of the horizon bands
of dark horsemen in tall, pointed hats were silhouetted
against the bright sky. The Yakuts were
hurrying to church.</p>

<p>The moon went down, and a small, whitish cloud
appeared in the zenith, shining with suffused, phosphorescent
lustre. It gathered size, it broke, it flickered,
and rays of iridescent light spread swiftly from
it in all directions, while the dark, semicircular cloud
in the north grew blacker and blacker, more sombre
than the forest which Makar was approaching.</p>

<p>The road wound through a dense, low thicket with
little hills rising on either hand; the farther it
advanced, the higher grew the trees, until at last the
taiga<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> closed about it, mute and pregnant with mystery.
The naked branches of the larches drooped
under their loads of silvery rime. The soft radiance
of the Aurora filtered through the tree-tops, and
strayed across the frosty earth, unveiling now an
icy glade, now the fallen trunk of some giant of the
forest half buried in the snow.</p>

<p>Another moment, and again all was sunk in murky<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
darkness, full-fraught with secrecy and silence. Makar
stopped. Here, almost at the side of the road,
were set the first units of an elaborate system of
traps. He could see clearly in the phosphorescent
light the low stockade of fallen timber and the first
trap&mdash;three long, heavy logs resting upon an upright
post, and held in place by a complicated arrangement
of levers and horse-hair ropes.</p>

<p>To be sure, these traps were not his, but might
not a fox have been caught in them, too? Makar
quickly got out of his sled, left the clever piebald
standing in the road, and listened attentively.</p>

<p>Not a sound in the forest! Only the solemn ringing
of the church bells came floating as before from
the distant, invisible village.</p>

<p>There was nothing to fear. Aliosha, the owner
of the traps and Makar&#8217;s neighbour and bitter
enemy, was no doubt in church. Not a track could
be seen on the smooth breast of the new-fallen snow.</p>

<p>Makar struck into the thicket&mdash;no one was there.</p>

<p>The snow creaked under foot. The log traps lay
side by side like a row of cannon with gaping jaws,
in silent expectation.</p>

<p>Makar walked up and down the line without finding
anything, and turned back to the road.</p>

<p>But what was that? A faint rustle! The gleam
of red fur near at hand in a spot of light! Makar
saw clearly the pointed ears of a fox; it waved its
bushy tail from side to side as if to beckon him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
into the forest, and vanished among the tree-trunks
in the direction of his traps. Next moment a dull,
heavy thud resounded through the forest, ringing
out clearly at first, and then echoing more faintly
under the canopy of trees, until it died softly away
in the dark abysses of the taiga.</p>

<p>Makar&#8217;s heart leapt&mdash;a trap had fallen!</p>

<p>He sprang toward the sound, pushing his way
through the undergrowth. The icy twigs whipped
his eyes and showered snow in his face; he stumbled
and lost his breath.</p>

<p>At last he ran into a clearing that he himself had
made. Hoary white trees surrounded the little
glade, and a shrinking path crept across it, with the
mouth of a large trap guarding its farther end.
A few steps more and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly, the figure of a man appeared on the
path near the trap&mdash;appeared and vanished. Makar
recognised Aliosha. He saw distinctly his short, massive,
stooping form and his walk like a bear&#8217;s. His
dark face looked blacker than he had ever seen it,
Makar thought, and his large teeth showed in a
wider grin than ever.</p>

<p>Makar was seized with genuine anger. &#8220;The
scoundrel! He has been at my traps!&#8221; It was true
that Makar had just made the round of Aliosha&#8217;s
traps, but that was a different matter. The difference
was that when he visited other men&#8217;s traps he
felt afraid of being discovered, but when others came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
to his traps, he felt indignation and a longing to lay
hands on the man who had violated his rights.</p>

<p>He darted toward the fallen trap. There was the
fox! Aliosha, too, was approaching with his shuffling
bear&#8217;s walk; Makar must reach the trap first!</p>

<p>There lay the fallen log and under it glistened the
ruddy coat of the captive creature. The fox was
scratching at the snow with its paws exactly as
Makar had seen it scratch in his dream, and was
watching his approach with bright, burning eyes,
just as he had dreamt that it would.</p>

<p>&#8220;Titima! (Don&#8217;t touch it!) It is mine!&#8221; cried
Makar to Aliosha.</p>

<p>&#8220;Titima!&#8221; came Aliosha&#8217;s voice like an echo. &#8220;It
is mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both men ran up at the same moment, and both
began quickly to raise the log, freeing the animal
beneath it. As the log was lifted the fox rose too.
It gave a little jump, stopped, looked at the two
men with mocking eyes, and then, lowering its nose,
licked the place that had been caught under the log.
This done it hopped gaily away with a farewell flirt
of its tail.</p>

<p>Aliosha would have thrown himself after it, but
Makar caught him by the coat tails.</p>

<p>&#8220;Titima!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;It is mine!&#8221; And he started
after the fox.</p>

<p>&#8220;Titima!&#8221; echoed Aliosha&#8217;s voice again, and Makar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
felt himself seized, in turn, by the tails of his
coat, and saw Aliosha dart forward.</p>

<p>Makar was furious. He forgot the fox and rushed
after Aliosha, who now turned to flee.</p>

<p>They ran faster and faster. The twigs of the
larches knocked the cap from Aliosha&#8217;s head, but he
could not stop to regain it. Makar was already
upon him with a fierce cry. But Aliosha had always
been more crafty than poor Makar. He suddenly
stopped, turned round, and lowered his head; Makar
ran straight into it with his stomach and turned
head over heels in the snow. As he fell, that infernal
Aliosha snatched the cap from his head and vanished
into the forest.</p>

<p>Makar rose slowly to his feet. He felt thoroughly
beaten and miserable. The state of his mind was
pitiful. The fox had been in his hands and now&mdash;he
thought he saw it again in the darkening forest
wave its tail gaily once more and vanish forever.</p>

<p>Darkness was falling. The little white cloud in
the zenith could barely be seen, and beams of fading
light were flowing wearily and languidly from it as it
gently melted away.</p>

<p>Sharp rivulets of icy water were running in
streams over Makar&#8217;s heated body; the snow had
gone up his sleeves and was trickling down his back
and into his boots. That infernal Aliosha had taken
away his cap and Makar well knew that the pitiless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
cold does not jest with men who go into the taiga
without gloves and without a hat.</p>

<p>He had already walked far. According to his calculations
he should long since have been in sight of
the church steeple, but here he was still in the forest.
The taiga held him in its embrace like a witch. The
same solemn ringing came to his ears from afar; he
thought he was walking toward it, but the sound
kept growing more and more distant, and a dull
despair crept into Makar&#8217;s heart as its echoes came
ever more faintly to his ears.</p>

<p>He was tired; he was choking; his legs were shaking
under him. His bruised body ached miserably,
his breathing strangled him, his feet and hands were
growing numb, and red-hot bands seemed tightening
around his bare head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall die!&#8221; came more and more frequently into
his mind, but still he walked on.</p>

<p>The taiga held its peace. It closed about him
with obdurate hostility and gave him no light and
no hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall die!&#8221; Makar kept thinking.</p>

<p>His strength left him altogether. The saplings
now beat him squarely in the face without the least
shame, in derision at his helpless plight. As he
crossed one little glade a white hare ran out, sat up
on its hind legs, waved its long, black-tipped ears,
and began to wash its face, making the rudest grimaces
at Makar. It gave him to understand that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
knew him well, knew him to be the same Makar who
had devised cunning means of destruction for it in
the forest; but now it was its turn to jeer.</p>

<p>Makar felt bitterly sad. The taiga grew more
animated, but with a malign activity. Even the distant
trees now threw their long branches across his
way, snatched at his hair, and beat his face and
eyes. The ptarmigans came out of their secret coverts
and fixed their round, curious eyes upon him,
and the wood-grouse ran in and out among them with
drooping tails and angry, spreading wings, loudly
telling their mates of him, Makar, and of his snares.
Finally, a thousand fox-faces glanced from the distant
thickets; they sniffed the air and looked derisively
at him, pricking their sharp ears. Then the
hares came and stood on their hind legs before him
and shouted with laughter as they told of Makar&#8217;s
misfortune.</p>

<p>That was too much.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall die!&#8221; thought Makar, and he decided to
do so as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>He lay down on the snow.</p>

<p>The cold increased. The last rays of the Aurora
flickered faintly and stretched across the sky to peep
at Makar through the tree-tops. The last echoes
of the church bells came floating to him from far-away
Chalgan.</p>

<p>The Northern Lights flared up and went out.
The bells ceased ringing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>Makar died.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He did not notice how this came to pass. He
knew that something should come out of him, and
waited, thinking every moment it would come, but
nothing appeared.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he realised that he was now dead,
and he therefore lay very still; he lay so long that
he grew tired.</p>

<p>The night was dark when Makar felt someone
push him with his foot. He turned his head and
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>The larches were now standing meekly and quietly
over him, as if ashamed of their former pranks. The
shaggy spruces stretched out their long snow-covered
arms and rocked themselves gently, gently, and
the starry snowflakes settled softly through the air.</p>

<p>The kind, bright stars looked down through the
branches from the dark blue sky, and seemed to be
saying: &#8220;See, a poor man has died!&#8221;</p>

<p>Over Makar&#8217;s prostrate form and prodding him
with his foot stood the old priest Ivan. His long
cassock was white with snow; snow lay upon his fur
hat, his shoulders, and his beard. Most surprising
of all was the fact that this was the same Father
Ivan who had died five years ago.</p>

<p>He had been a good priest. He had never pressed
Makar for his tithes and had not even asked to be
paid for the services of the church; Makar had always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
fixed the price of his own christenings and
requiems, and he now remembered with confusion that
it had sometimes been extremely low and that sometimes
he had not even paid it at all. Father Ivan had
never resented this, he had only required one thing:
a bottle of vodka on every occasion. If Makar had
no money, Father Ivan would send him for the bottle
himself, and they would drink it together. The good
priest always grew as drunk as a lord, but he fought
neither fiercely nor often. Makar would see him
home, and hand him over, helpless and defenseless, to
the care of the Mother Priestess, his wife.</p>

<p>Yes, he had been a good priest, but his end had
been bad.</p>

<p>One day, when there was no one else at home, the
fuddled Father, who was lying alone on the bed, had
taken it into his head to smoke. He got up and
staggered toward the great, fiercely heated fireplace
to light his pipe at the blaze. But he was too drunk,
he swayed and fell into the fire. When his family
returned, all that remained of the little Father were
his feet.</p>

<p>Every one regretted good Father Ivan, but no
doctor on earth could have saved him, as only his
feet remained. So they buried the feet, and a new
priest was appointed to fill the place of Father Ivan.</p>

<p>And now Ivan himself, sound and whole, was
standing over Makar, prodding him with his foot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>&#8220;Get up, Makar, old man!&#8221; he was saying, &#8220;and
let us be going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where must I go?&#8221; asked Makar with displeasure.
He supposed that once dead he ought to lie
still, and that there was no need for him now to be
wandering about the forest, losing his way. If he
had to do that, then why had he died?</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go to the great Toyon.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I go to him?&#8221; Makar asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is going to judge you,&#8221; answered the priest in
a sorrowful, compassionate voice.</p>

<p>Makar recollected that, in fact, one did have to
appear at some judgment after one died. He had
heard that at church. The priest was right after
all; he would have to get up.</p>

<p>So Makar rose, muttering under his breath that
they couldn&#8217;t even let a man alone after he was dead.</p>

<p>The priest walked before and Makar followed.
They went always straight ahead, and the larches
stood meekly aside and allowed them to pass; they
were going eastward.</p>

<p>Makar noted with surprise that Father Ivan left
no tracks in the snow behind him; he looked under
his own feet and saw no tracks either; the snow lay
as fresh and smooth as a table cloth.</p>

<p>How easy it would be now, he reflected, to rob
other men&#8217;s traps, as no one could find him out! But
the priest must have read his secret thought, for he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
turned and said: &#8220;Kabis! (stop that!). You don&#8217;t
know what you will get for thoughts like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I declare!&#8221; exclaimed the disgusted Makar.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t I even think what I please? What makes you
so strict these days? Hold your tongue!&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest shook his head and walked on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have we far to go?&#8221; asked Makar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a long way,&#8221; answered the priest sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what shall we have to eat?&#8221; Makar inquired
with anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have forgotten that you are dead,&#8221; the
priest answered turning toward him. &#8220;You won&#8217;t
have to eat or drink now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Makar did not like that idea in the least. Of
course it would be all right in case there were nothing
to eat, but then one ought to lie still, as he did
at first after his death. But to walk, and to walk
a long way, and to eat nothing, that seemed to him
to be absolutely outrageous. He began muttering
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t grumble!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; he answered in an injured voice and
went on complaining and growling to himself about
such a stupid arrangement.</p>

<p>&#8220;They make a man walk and yet he needn&#8217;t eat!
Who ever heard of such a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was extremely discontented as he followed the
priest. And they walked a long way. Though Makar
could not see the dawn, they seemed, by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
distance they had covered, to have been walking a
week. They had left so many ravines and hills behind
them, so many rivers and lakes, so many forests
and plains! Whenever Makar looked back, the dark
taiga seemed to be running away behind them and
the high, snowclad mountains seemed to be melting
into the murky night and hiding swiftly behind the
horizon.</p>

<p>They appeared to be climbing higher and higher.
The stars grew larger and brighter; from the crest
of the height to which they had risen they could
see the rim of the setting moon. It seemed to have
been in haste to escape, but Makar and the priest had
overtaken it. Then it rose again over the horizon,
and the travellers found themselves on a level, very
high plain. It was light now, much lighter than early
in the night, and this was due, of course, to the fact
that they were much nearer the stars than they had
been before. Each one of these, in size like an apple,
glittered with ineffable brightness; the moon, as large
as a huge barrel-head, blazed with the brilliance of
the sun, lighting up the vast expanse from one edge
to the other.</p>

<p>Every snowflake on the plain was sharply discernible,
and countless paths stretched across it, all converging
toward the same point in the east. Men
of various aspects and in many different garbs were
walking and riding along these roads.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>Makar looked sharply at one horseman, and then
suddenly turned off the road and pursued him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221; cried the priest, but Makar did
not even hear him. He had recognised a Tartar, an
old acquaintance of his, who had stolen a piebald
horse from him once, and who had died five years
ago. There was that same Tartar now, riding along
on the very same horse! The animal was skimming
over the ground, clouds of snowy dust were rising
from under its hoofs, glittering with the rainbow
colours of twinkling stars. Makar was surprised that
he should be able, on foot, to overtake the Tartar so
easily in his mad gallop. Besides, when he perceived
Makar a few steps behind him, he stopped with great
readiness. Makar fell upon him with passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to the sheriff with me!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;That is
my horse; he has a split in his right ear. Look at the
man, how smart he is, riding along on a stolen horse
while the owner follows on foot like a beggar!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gently,&#8221; said the Tartar. &#8220;No need to go for
the sheriff! You say this is your horse, take him
and be damned to the brute! This is the fifth year I
have been riding him up and down on one and the
same spot! Every foot-passenger overtakes me. It
is humiliating for a good Tartar, it is indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw his leg over the saddle in act to alight,
but at that moment the panting priest came running
up and seized Makar by the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunate man!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What are you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
about? Can&#8217;t you see that the Tartar is fooling
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he is fooling me!&#8221; shouted Makar waving
his arms. &#8220;That was a lovely horse, a real gentleman&#8217;s
horse; I was offered forty roubles for him
before his third spring. Never you mind, brother!
If you have spoilt that horse for me I shall cut him
up for meat, and you shall pay me his full value in
money! Do you think, because you are a Tartar,
there are no laws for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Makar was flying into a passion and shouting in
order to draw a crowd about him, for he was afraid
of Tartars from habit, but the priest broke in on his
outburst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gently, gently, Makar, you keep forgetting that
you are dead! What do you want with a horse?
Can&#8217;t you see that you travel much faster on foot
than the Tartar does on horseback? Would you
like to be forced to ride for a whole thousand years?&#8221;</p>

<p>Makar now understood why the Tartar had been
so willing to give up his horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a crooked lot!&#8221; he thought, and he turned
to the Tartar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Take the horse,
brother; I forgive you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Tartar angrily pulled his fur cap over his
ears and lashed his horse. The pony galloped madly,
and clouds of snow flew from under its hoofs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
but long as Makar and the priest stood still, the
Tartar did not budge an inch from their side.</p>

<p>He spat angrily and turned to Makar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, friend, haven&#8217;t you a bit of mahorka with
you? I do want to smoke so badly, and I finished
all mine five years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a friend of dogs but no friend of mine,&#8221;
retorted Makar in a rage. &#8220;You have stolen my
horse and now you ask for mahorka! Confound you
altogether, I&#8217;m not sorry for you one bit!&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words Makar moved on.</p>

<p>&#8220;You made a mistake not to give him a little
mahorka,&#8221; said Father Ivan. &#8220;The Toyon would
have forgiven you at least one hundred sins for that
at the Judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t you tell me that before?&#8221;
snapped Makar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it is too late to teach you anything now.
You should have learnt it from your priest while you
were alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Makar was furious. He saw no sense in priests
who took their tithes and did not even teach a man
when to give a leaf of mahorka to a Tartar in order
to gain forgiveness for his sins. One hundred sins
were no joke! And all for a leaf of tobacco! The
mistake had cost him dear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;One leaf will
do very well for us two. Let me give the other four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
to the Tartar this minute, that will mean four hundred
sins!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look behind you,&#8221; answered the priest.</p>

<p>Makar looked round. The white, empty plain lay
stretched out far behind them; the Tartar appeared
for a second upon it, a tiny, distant dot. Makar
thought he could distinguish the white cloud rising
from under the hoofs of his piebald, but next moment
the dot, too, had vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, the Tartar will manage all right without
his mahorka. You see how he has ruined my
horse, the scoundrel!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he has not ruined your horse,&#8221; answered the
priest. &#8220;That horse was stolen. Have you not heard
the old men say that a stolen horse will never go
far?&#8221;</p>

<p>Makar had certainly heard this from the old men,
but as he had often seen Tartars ride all the way to
the city on horses that they had stolen, he had never
put much belief in the saying. He now concluded
that old men were sometimes right.</p>

<p>They now began to pass many other horsemen on
the plain. All were hurrying along as fast as the
first; the horses were flying like birds, the riders
dripping with sweat, yet Makar and the priest kept
overtaking them and leaving them behind.</p>

<p>Most of these horsemen were Tartars, but a few
were natives of Chalgan; some of the latter were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
astride stolen oxen and were goading them on with
lumps of ice.</p>

<p>Makar looked with hatred at the Tartars, and
muttered every time he passed one that the fellow
had deserved much worse than this, but when he met
a peasant from Chalgan he would stop and chat
amicably with him, as they were friends, after all,
even if they were thieves! Sometimes he would even
show his fellow-feeling by picking up a lump of ice
and diligently beating the ox or horse from behind,
but let him take so much as one step forward himself,
and horse and rider would be left far in the
rear, a scarcely visible dot.</p>

<p>The plain seemed to be boundless. Though Makar
and his companion occasionally overtook these riders
and pedestrians, the country around was deserted,
and the travellers seemed to be separated by hundreds
of thousands of miles.</p>

<p>Among others, Makar fell in with an old man unknown
to him, who plainly hailed from Chalgan;
this could be discerned from his face, his clothes,
and even from his walk, but Makar could not remember
ever having seen him before. The old man
wore a ragged fur coat, a great shaggy hat, tattered
and worn leather breeches, and still older calf-skin
boots. Worst of all, he was carrying on his shoulders,
in spite of his old age, a crone still more ancient
than himself, whose feet trailed on the ground.
The old man was wheezing and staggering along,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
leaning heavily on his stick. Makar felt sorry for
him. He stopped and the old man stopped too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kansi! (Speak!)&#8221; said Makar pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered the greybeard.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you seen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Makar was silent for a while, and then thought
he might ask the old man who he was and whence
he had crawled.</p>

<p>The old man told his name. Long since, he said&mdash;he
did not know himself how many years ago&mdash;he
had left Chalgan and gone up to the &#8220;mountain&#8221;
to save himself. There he had done no work, had
lived on roots and berries, and had neither ploughed
nor sowed nor ground wheat nor paid taxes. When
he died he went to the Judgment of the Toyon. The
Toyon asked him who he was, and what he had done.
He answered he had gone up on the &#8220;mountain&#8221; and
had saved himself. &#8220;Very well,&#8221; the Toyon answered,
&#8220;but where is your wife? Go and fetch her
here.&#8221; So he went back for his old woman. But
she had been forced to beg before she died, as there
had been no one to support her, and she had had
neither house, nor cow, nor bread. Her strength
had failed, and now finally she was not able to move
her legs. So he was obliged to carry her to the
Toyon on his back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>As he said this, the old man burst into tears, but
the old woman kicked him with her heels as if he had
been an ox, and cried in a weak, cross voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221;</p>

<p>Makar felt more sorry than ever for the old man,
and heartily thanked his stars that he had not succeeded
in going to the &#8220;mountain&#8221; himself. His
wife was large and lusty, and his burden would have
been even heavier than that of the old man; if, in
addition to this, she had begun to kick him as if he
were an ox, he would certainly have died a second
death.</p>

<p>He tried to hold the old woman&#8217;s feet out of pity
for his friend, but he had scarcely taken three steps
before he was forced to drop them hastily, or they
would certainly have remained in his hands; another
minute, and the old man and his burden were left
far out of sight.</p>

<p>For the remainder of his journey Makar met no
more travellers whom he honoured with marked attention.
Here were thieves crawling along step
by step, laden like beasts of burden with stolen
goods; here rode fat Yakut chieftains towering in
their high saddles, their peaked hats brushing the
clouds; here, skipping beside them, ran poor workmen,
as lean and light as hares; here strode a
gloomy murderer, blood-drenched, with haggard, furtive
eyes. He kept casting himself in vain into the
pure snow, hoping to wash out the crimson stains;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
the snow around him was instantly dyed red, but the
blood upon the murderer started out more vividly
than ever, and in his eyes there gleamed wild horror
and despair. So he ran on, shunning the frightened
gaze of all men.</p>

<p>From time to time the little souls of children came
flying through the air like birds, winging their way
in great flocks, and this was no surprise to Makar.
Bad, coarse food, dirt, the heat from the fireplaces,
and the cold draughts in the huts drove them from
Chalgan alone in hundreds. As they overtook the
murderer, the startled flocks wheeled swiftly aside,
and long after their passage the air was filled with
the quick, anxious whirring of their little pinions.</p>

<p>Makar could not help remarking that, in comparison
with the other travellers, he was moving at a
fairly swift pace, and he hastened to ascribe this to
his own virtue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen Asabit! (Father!)&#8221; he said. &#8220;What do
you think, even if I was fond of drinking I was a
good man, wasn&#8217;t I? God loves me, doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked inquiringly at Father Ivan. He had
a secret motive for asking this question, he wanted
to find out something from the old priest, but the
latter answered curtly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be conceited! We are near the end now.
You will soon find that out for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Makar had not noticed until then that a light
seemed to be breaking over the plain. First a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
lambent rays flashed up over the horizon, spreading
swiftly across the sky and extinguishing the bright
stars. They went out, the moon set, and the plain
lay in darkness.</p>

<p>Then mists arose on the plain and stood round
about it like a guard of honour.</p>

<p>And at a certain point in the east the mists grew
bright like a legion of warriors in golden armour.</p>

<p>And then the mists stirred, and the warriors prostrated
themselves upon the ground.</p>

<p>And the sun rose from their midst, and rested upon
their golden ranks, and looked across the plain.</p>

<p>And the whole plain shone with a wonderful, dazzling
radiance.</p>

<p>And the mists rose triumphantly in a mighty host,
parted in the south, swayed, and swept upwards.</p>

<p>And Makar seemed to hear a most enchanting melody,
the immemorial p&aelig;an with which the earth daily
greets the rising sun. He had never before given it
due attention, and only now felt for the first time
the beauty of the song.</p>

<p>He stood and hearkened and would not go any
farther; he wanted to stand there forever and listen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But Father Ivan touched him on the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have arrived,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let us go in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon Makar noticed that they were standing
before a large door which had previously been
hidden by the mist.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>He was very loath to proceed, but could not fail to
comply.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They entered a large and spacious hut, and not
until then did Makar reflect that it had been very
cold outside. In the middle of the hut was a chimney
of pure silver marvellously engraved, and in it
blazed logs of gold, radiating such an even heat that
one&#8217;s whole body was penetrated by it in an instant.
The flames in this beautiful fireplace neither scorched
nor dazzled the eyes, they only warmed, and once
more Makar wanted to stand there and toast himself
forever. Father Ivan, too, came and stood before
the fire, stretching out his frozen hands to the blaze.</p>

<p>Four doors opened out of the room, and of these
only one led into the open air; through the other
three young men in long white gowns were coming
and going. Makar imagined that they must be the
servants of this Toyon. He seemed to remember
having seen them somewhere before, but could not
recollect exactly where. He was not a little surprised
to note that each servant wore a pair of large
white wings upon his back, and decided that the
Toyon must have other workmen beside these, for
surely they, encumbered with their wings, could never
make their way through the forest thickets when they
went to cut wood or poles.</p>

<p>One of the servants approached the fire, and, turning
his back to the blaze, addressed Father Ivan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>&#8220;Speak!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nought to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you hear in the world?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both were silent, and then the priest said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have brought this one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he from Chalgan?&#8221; asked the servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, from Chalgan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we must get ready the big scales.&#8221;</p>

<p>He left the room to make his preparations, and
Makar asked the priest why scales were needed, and
why they must be large.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; answered the priest a trifle embarrassed,
&#8220;the scales are needed to weigh the good and
evil you did when you were alive. With all other
people the good and evil almost balance one another,
but the inhabitants of Chalgan bring so many sins
with them that the Toyon had to have special scales
made with one of the bowls extra large in order to
contain them all.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words Makar quailed, and felt his heart-strings
tighten.</p>

<p>The servant brought in and set up the big scales.
One bowl was small and of gold, the other was wooden
and of huge proportions. A deep black pit suddenly
opened under the wooden bowl.</p>

<p>Makar approached the scales, and carefully inspected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
them to make sure they were not false. They
proved to be correct; the bowls hung motionless,
without movement up or down.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, he did not exactly understand
their mechanism, and would have preferred to have
done business with the simple balances by whose aid
he had learned to buy and sell with great profit to
himself during the course of his long life.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Toyon is coming!&#8221; cried Father Ivan suddenly,
and hastily began to pull his cassock straight.</p>

<p>The central door opened and in came an ancient,
venerable Toyon, his long silvery beard hanging
below his waist. He was dressed in rich furs and
tissues unknown to Makar, and on his feet he wore
warm velvet-lined boots, such as Makar had seen
depicted on antique ikons.</p>

<p>Makar recognised him at a glance as the same
old greybeard whose picture he had seen in church,
only here he was unattended by his son. Makar
decided that the latter must have gone out on business.
The dove flew into the room, however, and
after circling about the old man&#8217;s head, settled upon
his knee. The old Toyon stroked the dove with
his hand as he sat on the seat that had been especially
prepared for him.</p>

<p>The Toyon&#8217;s face was kind, and when Makar became
too downcast he looked at it and felt better.</p>

<p>His heart was heavy because he was suddenly remembering
all his past life down to the smallest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
detail; he remembered every step he had taken,
every blow of his axe, every tree he had felled, every
deceit he had practiced, every glass of vodka he had
drunk.</p>

<p>He grew frightened and ashamed, but he took
heart as he looked at the face of the old Toyon.</p>

<p>And as he took heart it occurred to him that
there might be some things he could manage to conceal.</p>

<p>The old Toyon looked searchingly at him and
asked him who he was and whence he had come, what
his name was and what his age might be.</p>

<p>When Makar had replied to his questions, the old
Toyon asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you done in your life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that yourself,&#8221; answered Makar.
&#8220;Surely it is written in your book!&#8221;</p>

<p>Makar wanted to test the Toyon and find out
whether everything was really inscribed there or
no.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me yourself,&#8221; answered the old Toyon.</p>

<p>Makar took courage.</p>

<p>He began enumerating all his works, and although
he remembered every blow he had struck with his axe,
every pole he had cut, and every furrow he had
ploughed, he added to his reckoning thousands of
poles and hundreds of loads of wood and hundreds
of logs and hundreds of pounds of sown seed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>When all had been told, the old Toyon turned to
Father Ivan and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring hither the book.&#8221;</p>

<p>Makar saw from this that Father Ivan was secretary
to the Toyon, and was annoyed that the other
had given him no friendly hint of the fact.</p>

<p>Father Ivan brought the great book, opened it,
and began to read.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just look and see how many poles are inscribed
there,&#8221; said the old Toyon.</p>

<p>Father Ivan looked and answered sorrowfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;He added a round three thousand to his reckoning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie!&#8221; shouted Makar vehemently. &#8220;He must
be wrong because he was a drunkard and died a
wicked death!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet!&#8221; commanded the Toyon. &#8220;Did he
charge you more than was fair for christenings and
weddings? Did he ever press you for tithes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why waste words?&#8221; answered Makar.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; the Toyon said, &#8220;I know without assistance
from you that he was fond of drink&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And the old Toyon lost his temper. &#8220;Read his
sins from the book now; he is a cheat, and I can&#8217;t believe
his words!&#8221; he cried to Father Ivan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the servants were heaping into the
golden bowl all Makar&#8217;s poles, and his wood, and
his ploughing, and all his work. And there proved to
be so much that the golden bowl sank, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
wooden bowl rose out of reach, high, high into the
air. So the young servants of God flew up to it on
their pinions and hundreds of them pulled it to the
floor with ropes.</p>

<p>Heavy is the labour of a native of Chalgan!</p>

<p>Then Father Ivan began adding up the number of
frauds that Makar had committed, and there proved
to be twenty-one thousand, three hundred and three.
Then he added up the number of bottles of vodka
he had drunk, and there proved to be four hundred.
And the priest read on and Makar saw that the
wooden bowl was pulling on the gold one; it sank
into the hole, and, as the priest read, it descended
ever deeper and deeper.</p>

<p>Makar realised then that things were going badly
for him; he stepped up to the scales and furtively
tried to block them with his foot.</p>

<p>But one of the servants saw it, and a clamour arose
amongst them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter there?&#8221; asked the old Toyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he was trying to block the scales with his
foot!&#8221; cried the servant.</p>

<p>At that the Toyon turned wrathfully to Makar,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that you are a cheat, a sluggard, and a
drunkard. You have left your arrears unpaid behind
you, you owe tithes to the priest, and the policeman
is steadily sinning on your account by swearing
every time he speaks your name.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>Then, turning to Father Ivan, the old Toyon
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who in Chalgan gives the heaviest loads to his
horses to pull, and who works them the hardest?&#8221;</p>

<p>Father Ivan answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;The church warden. He carries the mail and
drives the district policeman.&#8221;</p>

<p>To that the Toyon answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hand over this sluggard to the church warden
for a horse and let him pull the policeman until
he drops&mdash;we shall see what will happen next.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as the Toyon was saying these words, the
door opened; his son entered the hut and sat down
at his right hand.</p>

<p>And the son said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard the sentence pronounced by you.
I have lived long on the earth, and I know the ways
of the world. It will be hard for the poor man to
take the place of the district policeman&#8217;s horse.
However, so be it, only mayhap he still has something
to say: speak baraksan! (poor fellow!)&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there happened a strange thing. Makar,
the Makar who had never before in his life uttered
more than ten words at a time, suddenly felt himself
possessed of the gift of eloquence. He began speaking,
and wondered at himself. There seemed to be
two Makars, the one talking, the other listening and
marvelling. He could scarcely believe his ears. His
discourse flowed from his lips with fluency and passion;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
the words pursued one another swiftly, and
ranged themselves in long and graceful rows. He
did not hesitate. If by any chance he became confused,
he corrected himself and shouted twice louder
than before. But above all he felt that his words
were carrying conviction.</p>

<p>The ancient Toyon, who had at first been a little
annoyed by his boldness, began listening with rapt
attention, as if he were being persuaded that Makar
was not the fool that he seemed to be. Father Ivan
had been frightened for an instant and had plucked
Makar by the coat-tails, but Makar had pushed him
aside and continued his speech. The fears of the old
priest were quickly allayed; he even beamed at Makar
as he heard his old parishioner boldly declaring
the truth, and saw that that truth was pleasing to
the heart of the ancient Toyon. Even the young
servants of the Toyon with their long gowns and
their white wings came out of their quarters and
stood in the doorways listening with wonder to
Makar&#8217;s words, nudging one another with their elbows.</p>

<p>Makar commenced his plea by saying that he did
not want to take the place of the church warden&#8217;s
horse. Not because he was afraid of hard work, but
because the sentence was unjust. And because the
sentence was unjust, he would not submit to it; he
would not do a stroke of work nor move one single
foot. Let them do what they would with him! Let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
them hand him over to the devils forever, he would
not haul the policeman, because to condemn him to
do so was an injustice. And let them not imagine
that he was afraid of being a horse. Although
the church warden drove his horse hard, he fed him
with oats, but he, Makar, had been goaded all his
life, and no one had ever fed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who has goaded you?&#8221; asked the Toyon.</p>

<p>Yes, all his life long he had been goaded. The
bailiff had goaded him; the tax assessor and the
policeman had goaded him, demanding taxes and
tallage; hunger and want had goaded him; cold
and heat, rain and drought had goaded him; the
frozen earth and the ruthless forest had goaded
him. The horse had trudged on with its eyes on
the ground, ignorant of its journey&#8217;s end; so had he
trudged through life. Had he known the meaning
of what the priest read in church or for what his
tithes were demanded? Had he known why his eldest
son had been taken away as a soldier and whither
he had gone? Had he known where he had died and
where his poor bones had been laid?</p>

<p>He had drunk, it was charged, too much vodka; so
he had, for his heart had craved it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many bottles did you say that he drank?&#8221;
the Toyon asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four hundred,&#8221; answered Father Ivan, with a
glance at the book.</p>

<p>That might be so, pleaded Makar, but was it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
really all vodka? Three quarters of it was water;
only one quarter was vodka, and that was stiffened
with vile mahorka. Three hundred bottles might
well be deducted from his account.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is what he says true?&#8221; asked the ancient Toyon
of Father Ivan, and it was plain that his anger was
not yet appeased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely true,&#8221; the priest answered quickly,
and Makar continued his tale.</p>

<p>It was true that he had added three thousand
poles to his account, but what if he had? What
if he had only cut sixteen thousand? Was that so
small a number? Besides, while he had cut two
thousand his first wife had been ill. His heart had
been aching, he had longed to sit by her bedside,
but want had driven him into the forest, and in the
forest he had wept, and the tears had frozen on his
eye-lashes, and because of his grief, the cold had
struck into his very heart, and still he had chopped.</p>

<p>And then his old woman had died. He had to bury
her, but he had no money to pay for the burial. So
he had hired himself out to chop wood to pay for
his wife&#8217;s abode in the world beyond. The merchant
had seen how great was his need, and had only paid
him ten kopecks&mdash;and his old woman had lain all
alone in the icy hut while he had once more chopped
wood and wept. Surely each one of those loads
should be counted as four or even more!</p>

<p>Tears rose in the eyes of the old Toyon, and Makar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
saw the scales trembling and the wooden bowl rising
as the golden one sank.</p>

<p>And still he talked on.</p>

<p>Everything was written down in their book, he
said, let them look and see if any one had ever done
him a kindness or brought him happiness and joy!
Where were his children? If they had died his heart
had been heavy and sad; if they had lived to grow
up they had left him, to carry on their fight alone
with their own grinding needs. So he had remained
to grow old with his second wife, and had felt his
strength failing and had seen that a pitiless, homeless
old age was creeping upon him. They two had
stood solitary as two lorn fir-trees on the steppe,
buffeted on every hand by the merciless winds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that true?&#8221; asked the Toyon again, and the
priest hastened to answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely true.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the scales trembled once more&mdash;but the old
Toyon pondered.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is this?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Have I not many on
earth who are truly righteous? Their eyes are clear,
their faces are bright, and their garments are without
a stain. Their hearts are mellow as well tilled
soil in which flourishes good seed, sending up strong
and fragrant shoots whose odour is pleasant to my
nostrils. But you&mdash;look at yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>All eyes were now turned on Makar, and he felt
ashamed. He knew that his eyes were dim, that his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
face was dull, that his hair and beard were unkempt,
that his raiment was torn. And though for some
time before his death he had intended to buy a pair
of new boots in which to appear at the Judgment, he
somehow had always managed to drink up the money,
and now stood before the Toyon in wretched fur
shoes like a Yakut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your face is dull,&#8221; the Toyon went on. &#8220;Your
eyes are bleared and your clothes are torn. Your
heart is choked with weeds and thistles and bitter
wormwood. That is why I love my righteous and
turn my face from the ungodly such as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Makar&#8217;s heart contracted and he blushed for his
own existence. He hung his head for a moment and
then suddenly raised it and took up his tale once
more.</p>

<p>Which righteous men did the Toyon mean? he
asked. If he meant those that lived on earth in
rich houses at the same time that Makar was there,
then he knew all about them! Their eyes were clear
because they had not shed the tears he had shed;
their faces were bright because they were bathed
in perfume, and their spotless garments were sewn
by other hands than their own.</p>

<p>Again Makar hung his head, and again raised it.</p>

<p>And did not the Toyon know that he too had come
into the world as they had with clear, candid eyes
in which heaven and earth lay reflected? That he
had been born with a pure heart, ready to expand to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
all the beauty of the world? Whose fault was it if
he now longed to hide his besmirched and dishonoured
head under the ground? He could not say.
But this he did know, that the patience of his soul
was exhausted!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of course Makar would have been calmer could
he have seen the effect that his speech was having
on the Toyon, or how each of his wrathful words fell
into the golden bowl like a plummet of lead. But he
saw nothing of this because his heart was overwhelmed
with blind despair.</p>

<p>He had gone over again the whole of his bitter
existence. How had he managed to bear the terrible
burden until now? He had borne it because the star
of hope had still beckoned him onward, shining like
a watch-fire through mists of toil and doubt. He
was alive, therefore he might, he would, know a happier
fate. But now he stood at the end, and the star
had gone out.</p>

<p>Darkness fell on his soul, and rage broke over it
as a tempest breaks over the steppe in the night.
He forgot who he was and before whose face he
stood; he forgot all but his wrath.</p>

<p>But the old Toyon said to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment, baraksan! You are not on
earth. There is justice here for you, also.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that Makar trembled. The idea that some one
pitied him dawned upon his mind and filled and softened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
his heart, but because his whole miserable existence
now lay exposed before him from his first day
to his last, unbearable self-pity overwhelmed him and
he burst into tears.</p>

<p>And the ancient Toyon wept with him. And old
Father Ivan wept, and the young servants of God
shed tears and wiped them away with their wide
sleeves.</p>

<p>And the scales wavered, and the wooden bowl rose
ever higher and higher!</p>

<p class="caption">A LEGEND OF THE POLYESIE<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The forest was murmuring.</p>

<p>There was always a murmuring in this forest, long-drawn,
monotonous, like the undertones of a distant
bell, like a faint song without words, like vague
memories of the past. There was always a murmuring
in the forest because it was a dense wood of ancient
pines, untouched as yet by the axe and saw of
the timber merchant. The tall, century-old trees
with their mighty red-brown trunks stood in frowning
ranks, proudly thrusting their green, interwoven
tops aloft. The air under them was still and
sweet with resin; bright ferns pierced the carpet of
needles with which the ground was clothed, and superbly
displayed their motionless, fringed foliage.
Tall, green grass-blades had shot upward in the moist
places, and there, too, white clover-heads drooped
heavily, as if overcome with gentle languor. And
always overhead, without a pause and without an end,
droned the voice of the forest, the low sighing of the
ancient pines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>But now these sighs had grown deeper and louder.
I was riding along a woodland path, and although
the sky was invisible, I knew, under the darkly frowning
trees, that a storm was gathering overhead. The
hour was late. A few last rays of sunlight were still
filtering in here and there between the tree-trunks,
but misty shadows had already begun to gather in the
thickets. A thunder-storm was brewing for the night.
I was forced to abandon all idea of continuing the
chase that day, and could only think of reaching a
night&#8217;s lodging before the storm broke. My horse
struck his hoof against a bare root, snorted, and
pricked his ears, harkening to the muffled impacts of
the forest echo. Then of his own accord he turned
his steps into the well-known path that led to the hut
of the forest guard.</p>

<p>A dog barked. White plastered walls gleamed
among the thinning tree-trunks, a blue wisp of smoke
appeared, curling upward under the overshadowing
branches, and a lop-sided cottage with a dilapidated
roof stood before me, sheltering under a wall of ruddy
tree-trunks. It seemed to have sunk down upon the
ground, while the proud graceful pines nodded their
heads, high, high above it. In the centre of the
clearing stood two oak trees, huddling close to one
another.</p>

<p>Here lived the foresters Zakhar and Maksim, the
invariable companions of my hunting expeditions.
But now they were evidently away from home, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
no one came out of the house at the barking of the
great collie. Only their old grandfather with his
bald head and his grey whiskers was sitting on a
bench outside the door, braiding shoes of bast. The
old man&#8217;s beard swept almost to his belt; his eyes
were vague as if he were trying in vain to remember
something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, daddy! Is any one at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, hey,&#8221; mumbled the old man, shaking his
head; &#8220;neither Zakhar nor Maksim is here and
Motria has gone into the wood for the cow. The cow
has run away; perhaps the bears have eaten her.
And so there is no one in the cottage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, never mind. I&#8217;ll sit here with you and
wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sit down and wait!&#8221; the old man nodded, and
watched me with dim, watery eyes as I tied my horse
to the branch of one of the oaks. The old man was
failing fast. He was nearly blind and his hands
trembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who are you, lad?&#8221; he asked, as I sat down
on the bench.</p>

<p>I was accustomed to hearing this question at every
visit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, hey; now I know, now I know,&#8221; said the old
man, resuming his work on the shoe. &#8220;My old head
is like a sieve; nothing stays in it now. I remember
people who died a long time ago, oh, I remember them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
well! But I forget new people. I have lived in this
world a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you lived in this forest long, daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, hey; a long time! When the Frenchmen
came into the Tsar&#8217;s country I was here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have seen much in your day. You must
have many stories to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man looked at me with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what would I have seen, lad? I have seen
the forest. The forest murmurs night and day,
winter and summer. One hundred years have I lived
in this forest like that tree there without heeding the
passage of time. And now I must go to my grave,
and sometimes I can&#8217;t tell, myself, whether I have
lived in this world or not. Eh, hey; yes, yes. Perhaps,
after all, I have not lived at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>A corner of the dark cloud moved out over the
clearing from behind the close-growing tree-tops, and
the pines that stood about the clearing rocked in the
first gusts of wind. The murmur of the forest swelled
into a great resonant chord. The old man raised
his head and listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;A storm is coming,&#8221; he said after a pause.
&#8220;I know. Oi, oi! A storm will howl to-night, and
will break the pines and tear them up by the roots.
The Master of the forest will come out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that, daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, hey; I know it! I know what the trees are
saying. Trees know what fear is as well as we do.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
There&#8217;s the aspen, a worthless tree that&#8217;s always getting
broken to pieces. It trembles even when there
is no wind. The pines in the forest sing and play,
but if the wind rises ever so little they raise their
voices and groan. This is nothing yet. There, listen
to that! Although my eyes see badly, my ears can
hear: that was an oak tree rustling. The oaks have
been touched in the clearing. The storm is coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, as a matter of fact, the pair of low, gnarled
oak trees that stood in the centre of the clearing,
protected by the high wall of the forest, now waved
their strong branches and gave forth a muffled rustling
easily distinguishable from the clear, resonant
notes of the pines.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, hey; do you hear that, lad?&#8221; asked the old
man with a childishly cunning smile. &#8220;When the
oak trees mutter like that, it means that the Master
is coming out at night to break them. But no, he
won&#8217;t break them! The oak is a strong tree, too
strong even for the Master. Yes indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What Master, daddy? You say yourself it is the
storm that breaks them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man nodded his head with a crafty look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, hey; I know that! They tell me there are
some people in the world these days who don&#8217;t believe
in anything. Yes indeed! But I have seen
him as plainly as I see you now, and better, because
my eyes are old now, and they were young then. Oi,
oi! How well I could see when I was young!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>&#8220;When did you see him, daddy? Tell me, do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was an evening just like this. The pines began
to groan in the forest. First they sang and
then they groaned: oh-ah-o-oh-a-h! And then they
stopped, and then they began again louder and more
pitifully than ever. Eh, hey; they groaned because
they knew that the Master would throw down many
of them that night! And then the oak trees began to
talk. And toward evening things grew worse until <i>he</i>
came whirling along with the night. He ran through
the forest laughing and crying, dancing and spinning,
and always swooping down on those oak trees
and trying to tear them up by the roots. And once
in the Autumn I looked out of the window, and <i>he</i>
didn&#8217;t like that. He came rushing up to the window
and, bang-bang, he broke it with a pine knot. He
nearly hit my face, bad luck to him! But I&#8217;m no
fool. I jumped back. Eh, hey; lad, that&#8217;s the sort
of a quarrelsome fellow he is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what does he look like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks exactly like an old willow tree in a
marsh. Just exactly! His hair is like dry mistletoe
on a tree, and his beard too; but his nose is like a
big fat pine knot and his mouth is as twisted as if it
were all overgrown with lichen. Bah, how ugly he
is! God pity any Christian that looks like him! Yes
indeed! I saw him once quite close, in a swamp. If
you&#8217;ll come here in the winter you can see <i>him</i> for
yourself. You must go in that direction, up that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
hill&mdash;it is covered with woods&mdash;and climb to the very
top of the highest tree. He can sometimes be seen
from there racing along over the tree-tops, carrying
a white staff in his hand, and whirling, whirling until
he whirls down the hill into the valley. Then he runs
away and disappears into the forest. Eh, hey! And
wherever he steps he leaves a foot-print of white
snow. If you don&#8217;t believe an old man come and see
for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man babbled on; the excited, anxious
voices of the forest and the impending storm seemed
to have set his old blood racing. The aged gaffer
laughed and blinked his faded eyes.</p>

<p>But suddenly a shadow flitted across his high,
wrinkled forehead. He nudged me with his elbow
and said with a mysterious look:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me tell you something, lad. Of course the
Master of the forest is a worthless, good-for-nothing
creature, that is true. It disgusts a Christian to
see an ugly face like his, but let me tell you the truth
about him: he never does any one any harm. He
plays jokes on people, of course, but as for hurting
them, he never would do that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you said yourself, daddy, that he tried to
hit you with a pine knot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, hey; he tried to! But he was angry then
because I was looking at him through the window;
yes indeed! But if you don&#8217;t go poking your nose
into his affairs he&#8217;ll never play you a dirty trick.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
That&#8217;s what he&#8217;s like. Worse things have been done
by men than by him in this forest. Eh, hey; they
have indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man&#8217;s head dropped forward on to his
breast and he sat silent for several minutes. Then
he looked at me, and a ray of awakening memory
seemed to gleam through the film that fogged his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you an old story of our forest, lad. It
happened here in this very place, a long, long time
ago. Almost always I remember it as in a dream.
But when the forest begins to talk more loudly, I
remember it well. Shall I tell it to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do, daddy! Tell me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I&#8217;ll tell you; eh, hey! Listen!&#8221;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>My father and mother died, you know, a long time
ago when I was only a little lad. They left me
in the world alone. That&#8217;s what happened to me,
eh, hey! Well, the village warden looked at me
and thought: &#8220;What shall we do with this boy?&#8221;
And the lord of the manor thought the same thing.
And at that time Raman, the forest guard, came
out of the forest, and he said to the warden: &#8220;Let
me have that boy to take back to my cottage with
me. I&#8217;ll take good care of him. It will be company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
for me in the forest and he will be fed.&#8221; That&#8217;s
what he said, and the warden answered: &#8220;Take
him!&#8221; So he took me. And I have lived in the forest
ever since.</p>

<p>Raman brought me up here. God forbid that any
one should look as terrible as he did! His eyes were
black, his hair was black, and a dark soul looked
out of his eyes because the man had lived alone in
the forest all his life. The bears, people said, were
his brothers and the wolves were his nephews. He
knew all the wild animals and was afraid of none,
but he kept away from people and wouldn&#8217;t even
look at them. That&#8217;s what he was like. It&#8217;s the
honest truth. When he looked at me I felt as if a
cat were tickling my back with its tail. But he was
a good man all the same, and I must say he fed me
well. We always had buckwheat porridge with
grease, and a duck if he happened to kill one. Yes,
he fed me well; it&#8217;s the truth and I must say it.</p>

<p>So we two lived together. Raman used to go out
into the forest every day and lock me up in the cottage
so that the wild animals shouldn&#8217;t eat me. Then
they gave him a wife called Aksana.</p>

<p>The Count, who was the lord of the manor, gave
him his wife. He called Raman to the village and
said to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Raman, you must marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I marry? What should I do with a wife<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
in the forest when I already have a boy there? I
don&#8217;t want to marry!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He wasn&#8217;t used to girls, that&#8217;s what the matter
was. But the Count was sly. When I remember
him, lad, I think to myself: there are no men like
him now, they are all gone. Take yourself, for
instance. They say you are a Count&#8217;s son too. That
may be true, but you haven&#8217;t got the&mdash;well the real
thing, in you. You&#8217;re a miserable little snip of a
boy, that&#8217;s all you are.</p>

<p>But he was a real one, just as they used to be.
You may think it a funny thing that a hundred men
should tremble before one, but look at the falcon,
boy, and the chicken! Both are hatched out of an
egg, but the falcon longs to soar as soon as his wings
are strong. Then, when he screams in the sky, how
not only the little chickens but the old cocks run!
The noble is a falcon, the peasant is a hen.</p>

<p>I remember when I was a little boy seeing thirty
peasants hauling heavy logs out of the forest and
the Count riding along alone on his horse, twirling
his whiskers. The horse under him was prancing, but
he kept looking from side to side. Oi, oi! When the
peasants met the Count, how they got out of his
way, turning their horses aside into the snow, and
how they took off their caps! They had heavy work
afterwards pulling the logs out of the snow back on
to the road while the Count galloped away. The
road had been too narrow for him to pass the peasants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
of course! Whenever the Count moved an eyebrow
the peasants trembled. When he laughed, they
laughed; when he frowned, they cried. No one ever
opposed the Count; it had never been done.</p>

<p>But Raman had grown up in the forest and did
not know the ways of the world, so the Count was
not very angry when he refused the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to marry,&#8221; the Count said. &#8220;Why I
want you to do it is my business. Take Aksana.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to,&#8221; answered Raman. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want her. Let the Devil marry her, I won&#8217;t! There
now!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count ordered a knout to be brought. They
stretched Raman out, and the Count asked him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you marry, Raman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then give it to him on the back,&#8221; commanded the
Count, &#8220;as hard as you can lay it on.&#8221;</p>

<p>They gave it to him good and hard. Raman was
a strong man, but he got tired of it at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, stop!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;That&#8217;s enough. May
all the devils in hell take her! I won&#8217;t suffer this
torture for any woman! Give her to me; I&#8217;ll marry
her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now there lived at the Count&#8217;s castle a huntsman
named Opanas. Opanas came riding in from the
fields just as they were persuading Raman to be
married. He heard Raman&#8217;s trouble and fell at the
Count&#8217;s feet. He fell down and kissed them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of thrashing that man, kind master?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Better let me marry Aksana with
a free will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eh, hey; he wanted to marry her himself. That&#8217;s
what he wanted, yes indeed!</p>

<p>So Raman was pleased and grew happy again. He
got up and tied up his breeches and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s splendid!&#8221; says he. &#8220;But why couldn&#8217;t
you have come a little sooner, man? And the Count
too&mdash;that&#8217;s how it always is! Wouldn&#8217;t it have been
better to have found out first who wanted to marry
her? Instead of that they grab the first man that
comes along and begin flogging him! Do you think
that is Christian?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Bah!&#8221;</p>

<p>Eh, hey; he didn&#8217;t have any mercy on the Count,
that&#8217;s the sort of man Raman was. When he got
angry it was safest to keep out of his way, even for a
Count. But the Count was sly! You see he was
after something. He ordered Raman to be stretched
out on the grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to make you happy, fool!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;And
you turn up your nose at me! You are living alone
now like a bear in his den; it is dull for me when I
come to see you. Lay it on to the fool until he says
he has had enough! As for you Opanas, go to the
devil! You weren&#8217;t asked to this party,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;So don&#8217;t sit down at the table unless you want to
be entertained like Raman.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Raman&#8217;s anger had gone beyond joking by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
that time, eh, hey! They tickled him well, and,
you know, people in those days could take a man&#8217;s
hide off beautifully with a knout, but he lay quite
still and never said: that&#8217;s enough! He endured it a
long time, but at last he spat and cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not right to baste a Christian like this for
a woman without even counting the stripes! That&#8217;s
enough! And may your hands shrivel and drop off,
you accursed servants! The devil himself must have
taught you to use the knout. Do you think I&#8217;m a
bundle of wheat on a threshing floor that you beat
me like this? If that&#8217;s your idea, I&#8217;m going to get
married.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Count laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s splendid!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Though you won&#8217;t
be able to sit down at your wedding, you will dance
all the livelier.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count was a jolly man, indeed he was, eh,
hey! Something bad happened to him afterwards
though; God forbid that anything like that should
ever happen to any Christian! I wouldn&#8217;t wish it for
any one. It wouldn&#8217;t be right to wish it even for a
Jew. That&#8217;s what I think about it.</p>

<p>Well, they got Raman married. He brought his
young wife to this cottage, and at first he did nothing
but scold her and blame her for his thrashing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not worth a thrashing to any man!&#8221; he
used to say.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>As soon as he came home out of the forest he would
chase her out of the house shouting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Away with you! I don&#8217;t want a woman in my
house! Don&#8217;t let me see you here again! I don&#8217;t
like to have a woman sleeping here. I don&#8217;t like the
smell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eh, hey!</p>

<p>But later he got used to her. Aksana swept
out the hut and painted it to look nice and clean, and
put the china neatly away, and at last everything
shone so brightly that one&#8217;s heart grew merry at
the sight of it. Raman saw what a good woman she
was, and little by little he got used to her. Yes, he
not only got used to her, lad, he began to love her.
Yes indeed, I am telling you the truth. That&#8217;s what
happened to Raman. When he found out what the
woman was like he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks to the Count I have learnt what a good
thing is. What a fool I was! How many stripes I
took, and now I see that it isn&#8217;t so bad after all! It
is even good. That&#8217;s the truth!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so some time passed, I don&#8217;t know exactly how
much. Then one day Aksana lay down on a bench
and began to groan. That evening she was ill, and
when I woke up in the morning I heard a shrill little
voice squeaking. Eh, hey, I thought to myself, I
know what has happened, a baby has been born! And
so it had.</p>

<p>The baby did not stay long in this world. Only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
from that morning until night. It stopped squeaking
in the evening. Aksana cried, but Raman said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The child has gone, so now we won&#8217;t call in the
priest. We can bury it ourselves under a pine tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what Raman said. And he not only said
it, he did it. He dug a little grave under a tree and
buried the child. There stands the old stump of the
tree to this day. It has been split by lightning. Yes,
that is the same pine tree under which Raman buried
the child. And I&#8217;ll tell you something, boy: to this
day when the sun goes down and the stars shine out
over the forest a little bird comes flying to that tree
and cries. It pipes so sadly, poor little bird,
that one&#8217;s heart aches to hear it. It is the little
unchristened soul crying for a cross. A learned man,
they say, who knows things out of books, could give
it a cross and then it would not fly about any more.
But we live here in the forest and don&#8217;t know anything.
It comes flying up begging for help and all
we can say is: &#8220;You poor, poor little soul, we can&#8217;t
do anything for you!&#8221; So then it cries and flies
away, and next day it comes back again. Ah, boy,
I&#8217;m sorry for the poor little soul!</p>

<p>Well, when Aksana got well again she was always
going to the grave. She would sit on the grave and
cry; sometimes she would cry so loudly that her voice
could be heard through the whole forest. She was
grieving for her baby, but Raman did not grieve for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
the baby, he grieved for her. He used to come back
out of the forest and stand by Aksana and say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet, silly woman! What is there to cry
for? One child has died but there may be another.
And a better one, perhaps! Because that
one may not have been mine, I don&#8217;t know whether
it was or not, but the next one will be mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>Aksana did not like it when he talked like that.
She would stop crying and begin to howl at him with
bad words. Then Raman would get angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you howling for?&#8221; he would ask. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t say anything of the kind. I only said I didn&#8217;t
know. And the reason I don&#8217;t know is because you
were living in the world among men then, and not in
the forest. So how can I be sure? Now you are living
in the forest; now it is all right. Old granny
Feodosia said when I went to the village to fetch her:
&#8216;Your baby came very quickly, Raman.&#8217; And I said
to the old woman: &#8216;How do I know whether it came
quickly or not?&#8217; But come now, stop bawling or I&#8217;ll
get angry, and might even beat you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, Aksana would shout at him for a while and
then she would stop. She would scold him and hit
him on the back, but when Raman began to get angry
himself she would grow quiet. She would be frightened.
She used to embrace him then, and kiss him,
and look into his eyes. Then my Raman would grow
quiet again. Because, you know, lad&mdash;but you probably
don&#8217;t know, though I do, even if I have never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
married, because I&#8217;m an old man&mdash;I know that a
young woman is so sweet to kiss that she can twist
any man around her finger at will no matter how
angry he is. Oi, oi, I know what these women are!
And Aksana was a tidy young thing; one doesn&#8217;t see
her like now-a-days. I&#8217;ll tell you, lad, women are not
what they were.</p>

<p>Well, one day a horn blew in the forest: tara-tara-ta-ta!
That&#8217;s how it echoed through the forest,
clearly and gaily. I was a little fellow then and
didn&#8217;t know what it was. I saw the birds rising from
their nests and flapping their wings and screaming,
and I saw the hares skipping over the ground with
their ears laid back, as fast as they could scamper.
I thought perhaps it was some unknown wild animal
making that pretty noise. But it was not a wild
animal, it was the Count trotting through the forest
on his horse and blowing his horn. Behind him came
his huntsmen leading their hounds on the leash. The
handsomest of all the huntsmen was Opanas, caracoling
behind the Count dressed in a long blue Cossack
coat. Opanas&#8217; cap had a peaked golden crown, his
horse was capering under him, his carbine was glistening
on his back, and his bandura<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> was slung across
his shoulder by a strap. The Count liked Opanas
because he played well on the bandura and was an
expert at singing songs. Ah, this lad Opanas was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
handsome, terribly handsome! The Count simply
didn&#8217;t compare with Opanas. The Count was bald
and his nose was red and his eyes, though they were
merry, were not like those of Opanas! When Opanas
looked at me&mdash;at me, a little whipper-snapper&mdash;I
couldn&#8217;t help laughing, and I wasn&#8217;t a young girl!
People said that Opanas&#8217; father was a Cossack from
beyond the Dnieper; every one there is handsome and
nimble and sleek. And think, boy, the difference
there is between flying across the plains like a bird
with a horse and a lance, and chopping wood with
an axe!</p>

<p>Well, I ran out of the hut and looked, and there
came the Count and stopped right in front of the
house, and the huntsmen stopped too. Raman ran
out of the hut and held the Count&#8217;s stirrup and the
Count climbed down from his horse. Raman bowed
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good day!&#8221; the Count says to Raman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, hey,&#8221; answers Raman. &#8220;I&#8217;m very well,
thanks, and how are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>You see, Raman didn&#8217;t know how to answer the
Count as he ought to have done. The attendants all
laughed at his words and the Count laughed too.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad you are well,&#8221; says the Count.
&#8220;And where is your wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where should my wife be? My wife is in the
hut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll go into the hut,&#8221; says the Count.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
&#8220;And meanwhile light a fire, lads, and prepare something
to eat, for we have come to congratulate the
young couple.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they went into the hut; the Count, and Opanas,
and Raman bareheaded behind them with Bogdan,
the oldest of the huntsmen and the Count&#8217;s
faithful servant. There are no servants like him in
the world now.</p>

<p>Bogdan was old and ruled the other attendants
sternly, but in the Count&#8217;s presence he was like that
dog there. There was no one in the world for Bogdan
except the Count. People said that when Bogdan&#8217;s
father and mother had died he had asked the old
Count for a house and land, for he wanted to marry.
But the old Count would not allow it. He made him
the young Count&#8217;s servant and said: &#8220;There are
your mother and father and wife!&#8221; So Bogdan took
the boy and taught him to ride and shoot. And the
young Count grew up and began to rule in his
father&#8217;s place, and old Bogdan still followed him like
a dog.</p>

<p>Okh, I&#8217;ll tell you the truth. Many people have
cursed Bogdan; many tears have fallen because of
him, and all on account of the Count. At one word
from the Count, Bogdan would have torn his own
father to shreds.</p>

<p>Well, I was a little fellow, and I ran into the house
behind the Count. I was curious to see what would
happen. Wherever he went I went too.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>Well, I looked, and there, standing in the middle
of the hut, I saw the Count stroking his whiskers and
laughing. And there was Raman standing first on
one foot and then on another, crushing his hat in
his hands, and there, too, was Opanas leaning against
the wall, looking, poor fellow, like a young oak in
a storm. He was frowning and sad.</p>

<p>All three were turned toward Aksana. Only old
Bogdan was sitting on a bench in a corner with his
top-knot<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> hanging down, waiting for the Count to
give him an order. Aksana was standing in a corner
by the stove with her eyes on the floor, as crimson
as that poppy there in the barley. Okh, it was plain
the witch felt that something wicked was about to
happen because of her. Let me tell you something,
lad: if three men stand looking at one woman nothing
good ever comes of it. Hair is sure to fly, if
nothing worse. I know that, because I have seen it
happen myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;How now, Raman, lad?&#8221; laughed the Count.
&#8220;Did I give you a good wife or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not bad,&#8221; answered Raman. &#8220;The woman will
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Opanas shrugged his shoulders, raised his
eyes to Aksana, and muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a woman she is! If only that goose hadn&#8217;t
got her!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>Raman overheard the words and turned to Opanas
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do I seem a goose to you, Lord Opanas?
Eh, hey; tell me that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you don&#8217;t know how to protect your
wife; that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re a goose.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what Opanas said to him! The Count
stamped his foot. Bogdan shook his head, but Raman
thought a minute and then raised his head
and looked at the Count.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I protect her?&#8221; he asked Opanas,
but his eyes were fixed on the Count. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
one here in the forest except wild beasts, unless it
is our gracious Count when he comes. Whom should
I protect her from? Look out, you misbegotten
Cossack you, don&#8217;t provoke me, or before you know
it I&#8217;ll have you by the forelock!&#8221;</p>

<p>And perhaps the business would have ended in a
thrashing if the Count hadn&#8217;t interfered. He
stamped his foot, and every one was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gently there, you Devil&#8217;s spawn,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
didn&#8217;t come here to fight. Congratulate the young
people first, and then in the evening we&#8217;ll go hunting
on the marsh. Here, follow me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count turned on his heel and left the hut.
The attendants had already spread a dinner under
the trees. Bogdan followed the Count, but Opanas
stayed with Raman in the front entry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be angry with me, brother,&#8221; said the Cossack.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
&#8220;Listen to what Opanas has to tell you. You
saw how I rolled in the dust at the Count&#8217;s feet, and
kissed his boots, and begged him to give me Aksana?
Well, God bless you, man! The priest has tied you
up; it&#8217;s your luck, I see, but my heart can&#8217;t stand
that wicked fellow making sport of you and of her
again. Hey ho, no one knows what I have in my
heart! It would be well were I to lay him in the
cold ground for a bed with the help of my gun!&#8221;</p>

<p>Raman stared at the Cossack and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you gone out of your head this hour, Cossack?&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not hear what Opanas began whispering to
Raman in the front entry in answer to this; I only
heard Raman clap him on the back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Okh, Opanas, Opanas! How wicked and cunning
people are in this world! I knew nothing of
this, living in the forest. Eh, hey, Count, Count,
what evil you have brought on your head!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; Opanas says to him. &#8220;Go now, and don&#8217;t
show anything, especially before Bogdan. You&#8217;re a
simple man and that hound of the Count&#8217;s is crafty.
Be sure you don&#8217;t drink much of the Count&#8217;s wine;
and if he sends you out on the marsh with the huntsmen
and himself wants to stay behind, lead the huntsmen
to the old oak tree, put them on a round-about
road, and tell them that you are going to walk
straight through the forest. Then come back here
as quick as you can.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>&#8220;Good,&#8221; says Raman. &#8220;It&#8217;s hunting I shall go,
though my gun won&#8217;t be loaded with bird-shot for
little birds, but with a good stout bullet for a bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they went out. The Count was sitting on a
carpet on the ground. He ordered a flagon of wine
and a goblet to be brought to him, filled a goblet full
and passed it to Raman. Eh, hey; the Count&#8217;s flagon
and goblet were fair to see and his wine was better
still. One little goblet, and your heart would be full
of happiness; another, and it would leap in your
breast; if a man were not used to it he would roll
under his seat after the third unless a woman were
there to lay him on top of it.</p>

<p>Eh, hey; I tell you, the Count was clever. He
wanted to make Raman drunk on his wine, but there
was no wine in the world that could overpower Raman.
He emptied one goblet from the Count&#8217;s hands
and then another, and still another, until his eyes
glowed like a wolf&#8217;s and his black whiskers began to
twitch. The Count at last grew angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;How sturdily that Devil&#8217;s spawn can lap up the
wine and never blink an eye! Any other fellow
would have been blubbering by now, but look at him,
lads; he is laughing still!&#8221;</p>

<p>The wicked Count well knew that if a man cried
from wine his top-knot would soon be trailing on the
table. But this time he had mistaken his man.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why should I cry?&#8221; asked Raman in return.
&#8220;That would even be rude. The gracious Count<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
comes to congratulate me on my marriage and I
begin to howl like a woman! Thank God I have nothing
to cry for yet; let my enemies do the crying!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That means you are contented?&#8221; asks the Count.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, hey! And why should I be discontented?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember how I betrothed you with the
help of a knout?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I not remember? I was a foolish
man then and didn&#8217;t know bitter from sweet. The
knout was bitter, but I loved it better than a woman.
Thanks to you, gracious Count, this fool has learned
to eat honey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, all right,&#8221; says the Count. &#8220;And now
I want you to do me a good turn. Go out on the
marsh with my huntsmen and shoot as many birds as
you can, and especially do I want you to get me a
blackcock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when does the Count send us out on the
marsh?&#8221; asks Raman.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you have had one more drink. Opanas
will sing us a song, and then go in God&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Raman fixes his eyes on the Count and says:</p>

<p>&#8220;That will not be easy. It is late, the marsh is
far, and, besides, the forest is murmuring in the wind;
there will be a storm to-night. How can one kill
a shy bird on an evening like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Count was drunk, and he was always
powerfully bad-tempered in his cups. He heard his
attendants whispering among themselves that &#8220;surely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Raman was right, there would soon be a storm,&#8221; and
he was very angry. He slammed down his goblet and
glared about him. Every man held his tongue.</p>

<p>Only Opanas was not afraid; he stepped out as
the Count had told him to do to sing his song with his
bandura. He tuned it, glanced sideways at the
Count, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to your senses, gracious Lord! When has
it ever been known that men went hunting birds at
night, in a dark forest, in the midst of a storm?&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s how bold he was! The other serfs of the
Count were afraid, of course, but he was a free man
of Cossack birth. An old Cossack player of the
bandura had brought him as a youngster from the
Ukraine. There, lad, the people had made trouble in
the town of Uman. They had put out this old Cossack&#8217;s
eyes, cut off his ears, and sent him out like
that into the world. So he had walked and walked,
from village to town, and wandered into our country
with the little lad Opanas as his guide. The
old Count took him into his house because he loved
beautiful songs. So when the old man died, Opanas
grew up in the palace. The young Count grew to
like him, and would often endure speeches from
him for which he would have flayed three skins off
the back of another man.</p>

<p>So it was now. He was angry at first, and the
men thought he was going to hit the Cossack, but
he soon spoke to Opanas and said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>&#8220;Oi, Opanas, Opanas! You&#8217;re a clever lad, but it&#8217;s
plain you don&#8217;t understand that no man should put
his nose in the crack of a door for fear some one
might slam it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s how he guessed the Cossack&#8217;s riddle! And
the Cossack saw at once he had guessed it. And he
answered the Count in a song. Oi, if the Count had
been able to understand a Cossack song, his Countess
might not have had to shed tears over him that night!
&#8220;Thank you, Count, for your wisdom,&#8221; said Opanas.
&#8220;Now in return I am going to sing to you. Listen
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he raised his head and looked up at the sky;
he saw an eagle soaring there and the wind driving
the dark clouds along. He listened and heard the
tall pines murmuring.</p>

<p>And once more he struck the strings of his
bandura.</p>

<p>Eh, lad, you never chanced to hear Opanas play,
and now you will never hear it! The bandura is a
simple trick, but oh, how well a man who knows it can
make it talk! When Opanas ran his hand across
the strings it told him everything: how the dark pine
forest sings in a storm; how the wind hums through
the sedge on the desert steppe; how the dry grass
whispers on a high Cossack grave.</p>

<p>No, lad, you won&#8217;t hear such playing as that now-a-days!</p>

<p>All kinds of people come here now that have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
not only in our Polyesie but in other countries as
well: all over the Ukraine, in Chirigin and Poltava
and Kiev. They say that players of the bandura
are out of fashion now and that you never hear them
at fairs and in the bazaars. I still have an old bandura
hanging on the wall of the hut. Opanas taught
me to play it, but no one has learnt to play it
from me. When I die&mdash;and that will be soon&mdash;who
knows, perhaps nobody in the wide world will ever
hear the notes of a bandura again. No, indeed!</p>

<p>And Opanas began singing a song in a low voice.
Opanas&#8217; voice was not loud; it was brooding and sad,
and went straight to the heart. And the song, lad,
was made up for the Count by the Cossack himself.
I have never heard it again, and when, later, I used
to tease Opanas to sing it, he always refused.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man for whom that song was sung,&#8221; he would
say, &#8220;is no longer in this world.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Cossack told the Count all the truth in that
song, and what the Count&#8217;s fate would be, and the
Count wept; the tears even trickled down his beard,
and yet it was plain that not one word did he understand.</p>

<p>Okh, I can&#8217;t remember the song; I can only remember
a few words. The Cossack sang about Count
Ivan:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Oi, Ivan! Alas, oi, Count!</div>
<div class="verse">The Count is clever and much he knows.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
<div class="verse">He knows that the falcon soars in the sky, and falls upon the crow.</div>
<div class="verse">Oi, Ivan! Alas, oi, Count!</div>
<div class="verse">But the Count does not know</div>
<div class="verse">How it is in this world,</div>
<div class="verse">That the crow will at last kill the falcon at its nest.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>There, lad! I seem to hear that song at this moment,
and to see those men again. There stands the
Cossack with his bandura; the Count is sitting on
his carpet; his head is bowed, and he is weeping. The
Count&#8217;s men are gathered about him and are nudging
one another with their elbows, and old Bogdan
is shaking his head. And the forest is murmuring,
just as it is murmuring now, and the bandura is
chiming softly, dreamily, while the Cossack sings of
how the Countess wept over the grave of Count Ivan:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;She cries, the Countess cries,</div>
<div class="verse">While over the grave of Count Ivan a black crow flies.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Okh, the Count did not understand that song. He
wiped his eyes and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now, Raman! Come, lads, mount your
horses! And you, Opanas, ride with them; I&#8217;ve had
enough of your singing! That was a good song, only
you sang of things that never happen in this world.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Cossack&#8217;s heart was softened by his song
and his eyes were dim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Okh, Count, Count,&#8221; says Opanas. &#8220;In my country
the old men say that legends and songs contain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
the truth. But in legends the truth is like iron that
has passed through the world from hand to hand for
many years and has grown rusty. But the truth in
songs is like gold that rust will never corrode. That&#8217;s
what the old men say!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Count waved his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be so in your country, but here it is not
so. Go, go, Opanas; I am tired of listening to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Cossack stood still for a moment and then fell
at the Count&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as I beseech you, Count!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Mount
your horse and ride home to your Countess! My
heart foretells disaster.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that the Count grew angry in earnest. He
kicked the Cossack aside with his boot as if he had
been a dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of my sight!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Now I see
that you&#8217;re not a Cossack but an old woman! Leave
me, or evil will befall you! What are you waiting
for, hounds? Am I no longer your master? Here,
I&#8217;ll show you something that your fathers never saw
done by my father!&#8221;</p>

<p>Opanas rose like a dark thunder-cloud and exchanged
glances with Raman. Raman was standing
off at one side, leaning on his carbine as if nothing
had happened.</p>

<p>The Cossack struck his bandura against a tree;
the bandura flew to pieces and the sound of its groan
echoed through the forest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>&#8220;Very well, then!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Let the devils in
the next world teach him who will not hear wise counsel
in this! I see, Count, you have no need of a
faithful servant!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the Count could answer Opanas had jumped
into his saddle and ridden away. The other attendants
mounted their horses too. Raman shouldered
his carbine and walked away; as he passed the hut
he called out to Aksana:</p>

<p>&#8220;Put the boy to sleep, Aksana; it is time. And
prepare a bed for the Count!&#8221;</p>

<p>They had soon all ridden away into the wood by
that road there, and the Count went into the hut;
only the Count&#8217;s horse was left standing outside, tied
to a tree. Night was already falling; a murmur was
going about the forest, and a few drops of rain were
falling, just as they are now. Aksana laid me to
sleep in the hayloft and made the sign of the cross
over me for the night. I could hear my Aksana
crying.</p>

<p>Okh, what could a little lad like me understand of
all that was going on? I wrapped myself in the
hay and lay listening to the storm singing its song
in the forest until I began to fall asleep.</p>

<p>Eh, hey! Suddenly I heard footsteps outside the
hut. They reached the tree, and some one untied the
Count&#8217;s horse. The horse snorted and stamped and
galloped away into the forest. The sound of its
hoofs soon died away in the distance. But before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
long I heard galloping again; some one was coming
down the road. This man rode up post haste,
jumped down from his saddle, and rushed to the
window of the hut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Count! Count!&#8221; cried the voice of old Bogdan.
&#8220;Oi, Count! Open the door quickly! That devil of
a Cossack means harm! He has let your horse loose
in the forest!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the old man had time to finish his sentence
he was seized from behind. I was frightened, for I
heard something fall.</p>

<p>The Count tore open the door and jumped out
with his carbine in his hand, but Raman caught him
in the front entry right by the top-knot as he had
done the other, and flung him to the ground as well.</p>

<p>The Count saw that things were going badly for
him and he cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, let me go, Raman, lad! Have you forgotten
the good turn I did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Raman answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember, wicked Count, the good turn you did
me and my wife. And now I shall pay you for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Count cried again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Help me, help me, Opanas, my faithful servant!
I have loved you as my own son!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Opanas answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;You drove your faithful servant away like a dog.
You have loved me as a stick loves the back which it
beats, and now you love me as the back loves the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
stick which beats it! I begged and implored you to
listen to me. You wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Count began calling to Aksana for help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Intercede for me, Aksana; you have a kind
heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>Aksana came running out, wringing her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I begged you on my knees, Count, at your feet
I once begged you, to spare my maidenhood, and to-night
I besought you not to defile me, a married
woman. You would not spare me, and now you are
asking mercy for yourself. Okh, do not ask it from
me; what can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go!&#8221; cried the Count once more. &#8220;You
will all go to Siberia because of me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not grieve for us, Count,&#8221; answered Opanas.
&#8220;Raman will be out on the marsh before your men
get back, and, as for me, I am alone in the world,
thanks to your kindness. I shan&#8217;t worry about myself.
I shall shoulder my carbine and be off into the
forest. I shall gather together a band of lusty lads
and we shall roam through the country, coming forth
out of the forest onto the highroads at night. When
we reach a village we shall make straight for the
Count&#8217;s domain. Come on, Raman, lad, raise up the
Count and let us carry his honour out into the rain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Count began to struggle and scream, but
Raman only growled under his breath, and Opanas
laughed. So they went out.</p>

<p>But I took fright. I rushed into the hut and ran<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
straight to Aksana. My Aksana was sitting on a
bench, as white as that plaster wall.</p>

<p>And the storm was raging in earnest through the
forest by now; the pines were shouting with many
voices, and the wind was howling, while from time
to time a clap of thunder would rend the air. Aksana
and I sat on a bench, and all at once I heard
someone groan in the forest. Okh, he groaned so
pitifully that to-day when I remember it my heart
grows heavy, and yet it happened many years ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aksana,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;dear Aksana, who is that
groaning in the forest?&#8221;</p>

<p>But she took me in her arms and rocked me and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to sleep, little lad, it is nothing! It is only&mdash;the
forest murmuring.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the forest was murmuring indeed! Oh, how
loudly it was talking that night!</p>

<p>We sat there together a little while longer and then
I heard what I thought was a shot in the forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aksana,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;dear Aksana, who is that
shooting with a gun?&#8221;</p>

<p>But she only rocked me and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet, be quiet, little lad; that is God&#8217;s lightning
striking in the forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she herself was crying, and holding me close
to her breast. She rocked me to sleep, repeating
softly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>&#8220;The forest is murmuring; the forest is murmuring,
little lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I lay in her arms and went to sleep.</p>

<p>And when morning came, lad, I jumped up, and
there was the sun shining and Aksana sitting all
dressed in the hut. I remembered what had happened
the night before and thought: &#8220;It was all a
dream!&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was not a dream; oi, no, not a dream; it
was true. I ran out of the hut into the forest. The
birds were singing and the dew was shining on the
grass. I ran into the thicket and there I saw the
Count and a huntsman lying side by side. The Count
was peaceful and pale, but the huntsman was grey,
like a dove, and stern as if he had been alive. On the
breasts of the Count and of the huntsman were
bloody stains.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Well, and what became of the others?&#8221; I asked,
seeing that the old man had bowed his head and was
silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, hey! That is all there is to the story, as
Opanas the Cossack used to say. He lived long in
the forest, roaming about the highroads and over the
domains of the nobles with his lads. His fate had
been written at his birth; his fathers had been robbers
and a robber he had to be. He came here to
this hut more than once, lad, most often when Raman
was away. He would come and sit for a while and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
sing a song and play upon his bandura. But when
he came with his comrades, Aksana and Raman would
always be here together to greet him. Okh, to tell
you the truth, lad, guilty deeds have been done here.
Maksim and Zakhar will soon come back out of the
forest&mdash;look well at them both. I say nothing to
them about it, but any one who knew Raman and
Opanas could tell at a glance which one of the boys
looks like which, although they are not the sons but
the grandsons of those men. That is what has been
done here in this forest, lad, in my memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the forest is murmuring loudly to-night.
There will be rain.&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The old man spoke the last words as if he were
tired. His excitement had died out, his tongue was
tripping, his head was shaking, and his eyes were full
of tears.</p>

<p>Night had fallen; the forest was wrapped in darkness.
The wind was thundering against the but like
a rising tide. The black tree-tops were tossing like
the crests of waves in a fierce gale.</p>

<p>Soon a merry barking announced the approach of
the dogs and their masters. Both foresters appeared
striding swiftly toward the hut, and behind
them came the panting Motria, driving in her lost
cow. Our company was now complete.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>A few minutes later we were sitting in the hut.
A cheerful fire was crackling in the stove; Motria
was preparing our supper.</p>

<p>Although I had seen Zakhar and Maksim many
times before, I now looked at them with especial
interest. Zakhar&#8217;s face was dark. His eyebrows
grew out from under a straight, low forehead, and
his eyes were sombre, although a natural kindness
and an inherent strength could also be read in his
features. Maksim&#8217;s glance was frank and his grey
eyes were caressing; he ruffled his fair curls now
and then, and his laugh was peculiarly ringing and
merry.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what has the old man been telling you?&#8221;
asked Maksim. &#8220;That old legend about our grandfather?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;There now, he always does that! When the forest
begins to murmur loudly he always remembers
the past. Now he won&#8217;t be able to sleep all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is like a little child,&#8221; added Motria, pouring
out the old man&#8217;s tea.</p>

<p>The old man seemed not to know that they were
talking of him. He had entirely collapsed, and was
smiling vacantly from time to time and nodding his
head. Only when the storm that was blustering
through the forest shook the hut did he seem to grow
anxious; then he would lend an ear to the noise,
harkening to it with a frightened look on his face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>Soon all grew quiet in the hut. A tallow-dip flickered
dimly and a cricket was chirping its monotonous
song. In the forest a thousand mighty but
muffled voices were talking together and calling
fiercely to one another through the night. Terrible
powers seemed to be holding a noisy conclave in the
outer darkness. From time to time the tumultuous
thunder would rise and swell and the door of the
hut would quiver as if some one were leaning against
it from the outside, hissing with rage, while the nocturnal
tempest piped a piteous, heart-breaking note
in the chimney. At moments the fury of the storm
would abate and an ominous silence would fall and
oppress the heart, until once more the thunder would
rise, as if the ancient pines had plotted to suddenly
tear themselves from their roots and fly away into
an unknown land in the arms of the blast.</p>

<p>I lost myself for a few moments in a confused
slumber, but it could not have been for long. The
gale was howling through the forest in many tones
and keys. The tallow-dip flared and lit up the hut.
The old man was sitting on his bench feeling about
him with his arms as if he expected to find somebody
near him. A look of fear and almost of childish
helplessness distorted the face of the poor old
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aksana!&#8221; I heard his piteous whisper. &#8220;Dear
Aksana, who is that groaning in the forest?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>His hands fluttered anxiously and he seemed to be
listening for a reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, hey,&#8221; he spoke again. &#8220;No one is groaning;
it is the noise of the storm in the forest. That is
all; it is the forest murmuring, murmuring&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes passed. Bluish flashes of lightning
stared every second or two into the little window,
and the tall, fantastic forms of the pines kept springing
out of the darkness and vanishing again into the
angry heart of the storm. Suddenly a brilliant light
dimmed the pale flame of the tallow-dip and a sharp,
near-by peal of thunder crashed over the forest.</p>

<p>The old man again moved anxiously on his bench.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aksana, dear Aksana, who is that shooting with
a gun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to sleep, grandfather, go to sleep,&#8221; I heard
Motria&#8217;s quiet voice answer from her place on the
stove. &#8220;It&#8217;s always like this. He always calls Aksana
if there&#8217;s a storm at night. He forgets that
Aksana has long been dead. Okh&mdash;ho!&#8221;</p>

<p>Motria yawned, whispered a prayer, and silence
fell once more in the hut, broken only by the noise
of the forest and the old man&#8217;s anxious whispering:</p>

<p>&#8220;The forest is murmuring, the forest is murmuring&mdash;dear
Aksana&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon a heavy rain began to fall, drowning with
its descending torrents the groans of the pines.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="caption">THE RUINS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> mother died when I was six years old. After her
death my father surrendered himself entirely to his
own grief, and seemed to forget my existence. He
caressed my little sister at times, and saw to her welfare
in his own way, because he could trace her mother&#8217;s
features in her face, but I grew up like a wild
sapling of the fields; no one gave me any especial
care, though, on the other hand, no one restricted my
freedom.</p>

<p>The little village where we lived was called Kniazh
Gorodok or Princetown. It belonged to a proud but
impoverished race of Polish noblemen, and presented
all the typical features of any small town in Southwestern
Russia, where the pitiful remnants of stately
Polish grandeur drag out their weary days in a
gently flowing current of incessant toil mingled with
the trivial bustle of Jewish &#8220;gesch&auml;ft&#8221; or business.</p>

<p>If you approached the village from the east, the
first thing that caught your eye was the prison&mdash;the
great architectural ornament of the town. The
village itself lay spread below you on the shores of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
its slumberous ponds, and you descended to it by a
steep highway that was barred at last by the traditional
city gates. The drowsy veteran who was
toasting his red face in the sun, the very embodiment
of tranquil sleep, would lazily raise the barrier, and
behold! you were in the town, although at first you
might not perceive it. Grey fences and vacant lots
littered with piles of rubbish were interspersed here
and there among the crumbling and staring-eyed little
&#8220;khatkas&#8221; or huts. Farther on, the wide market
place appeared, bright with the roofs of the Jewish
&#8220;travellers&#8217; rests,&#8221; while the Government buildings
gave an air of melancholy to the scene, with their
white walls and their barrack-like regularity of outline.
The wooden bridge thrown across the little
river would groan and tremble under the wheels of
your carriage, swaying like a decrepit old man. A
Jewish street led away from the bridge, lined with
warehouses, shops, miserable bazaars, and bakers&#8217;
booths, while the Hebrew money-changers sat at their
tables on the sidewalks under their parasols. Everywhere
were dirt and swarms of children tumbling in
the dust of the street. Another minute, however, and
you were already beyond the village. Softly the
birches would be whispering over the graves in the
cemetery, while the breeze stirred the wheat fields,
and sang in mournful cadences among the roadside
telegraph wires.</p>

<p>The little river, spanned by the above mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
bridge, flowed from one pond into another, and thus
enclosed the town at the north and south by swamps
and broad expanses of water. The ponds had grown
shallower from year to year, until at last they had
become choked by vegetation, and tall, thickly-growing
reeds now rippled like the sea upon the wide
marshes. In the centre of one of these ponds was
an island, and on the island stood an old, half-ruined
castle.</p>

<p>I remember with what terror I used always to contemplate
this mighty, decaying pile. Stories and legends,
each one more frightful than the last, were
current about it. The island, it was said, was artificial,
piled up by the hands of captive Turks. &#8220;The
castle is built upon human bones;&#8221; so ran the saying
among the old people of the village, and my childish
imagination pictured with horror thousands of Turkish
skeletons supporting with bony hands the island,
the castle, and the tall, pyramidal poplar trees. Of
course this only made the castle appear more terrible
than ever, and even on bright days, if, emboldened
by the sunlight and the loud voices of the birds,
we approached it too closely, it would ofttimes throw
us into spasms of panic fear, so horribly did the dark
cavities of its windows glower down upon us. A
mysterious rustling would seem to stray through its
deserted halls, and pebbles and bits of plaster would
come rattling down, awakening the muffled echoes.
At such times we would scamper away without even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
a glance behind us, seeming to hear, long after,
sounds of clattering and banging and laughter resounding
in our ears.</p>

<p>But, on autumn nights, when the giant poplars
swayed and chanted under the wind that came flying
to them across the ponds, this horror would spread
from the island to the mainland and would reign over
the whole village. &#8220;Oi vei mir!&#8221; the Jews would whisper
with terror, while God-fearing old citizens
crossed themselves, and even our nearest neighbour,
the blacksmith, the very incarnation of diabolical
strength, would come out into his little yard and,
making the sign of the cross, would mutter under
his breath a prayer for the peace of departed souls.</p>

<p>Old, grey-bearded Yanush, who, for lack of any
other abode, had taken refuge in a cellar of the
castle, had often told us that on such nights as these
he could clearly hear cries rising from under the
ground. It was the Turks stirring under the island,
knocking their bones together, and loudly charging
their Polish masters with cruelty. Then in the old
castle halls and on the island would resound the
clanking of arms, and the lords would call their liegemen
together with loud shouts. Yanush could hear
quite plainly, through the moaning and howling of
the storm, the stamping of horses&#8217; hoofs, the clashing
of swords, and the words of command. He even
heard, once, the great-grandfather of the present
Count, immortalised by the memory of his ruthless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
deeds, come trampling out on his blooded steed, and,
riding to the centre of the island, cry out with a
dreadful oath: &#8220;Silence there, you yelping heathen
dogs!&#8221;</p>

<p>The descendants of this Count had long since abandoned
the home of their ancestors. The greater part
of the ducats and treasure with which their coffers
had once been filled to overflowing had crossed over
the bridge into the hands of the Jews, and the last
representatives of the glorious line had built themselves
a commonplace white house on a hill a little
farther from the town. Here their tedious but vainglorious
lives were spent in contemptuous and dignified
isolation.</p>

<p>Only at rare intervals did the old Count, himself
a ruin as gloomy as the castle and the island, appear
in the little town, mounted on an old nag of
English breed. At his side through the streets rode
his daughter, majestic and thin, in a black riding-habit,
while their head groom followed respectfully
behind. The stately Countess was fated to remain
forever unwed. Any possible suitors who were her
equals in birth had faint-heartedly scattered across
the world in search of the rich daughters of merchants
in foreign lands, and had either deserted their
ancestral castles or had turned them over to be pulled
down by the Jews. As for the little town which lay
spread out at the foot of the hill, not a youth could
be found there who would dare to raise his eyes to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
the beautiful Countess. We little boys, on catching
sight of these three riders, would pick ourselves up
out of the soft dust of the street, and, scattering
timidly like a flock of birds into various houses, would
follow the gloomy lords of the terrible castle with
eyes full of curiosity and fear.</p>

<p>On a hill west of the town, among decaying crosses
and sunken graves, there stood a long-deserted dissenting
chapel, the offspring of a city in the valley
proper below. Hither, in days of yore, the chapel
bell had summoned the townsfolk in their clean if
plain surtouts, with staves in their hands in place of
the swords which rattled at the sides of the small
farmers, also called hither from the neighbouring
villages and farms by the clear notes of the chapel
bell.</p>

<p>From here could be seen the island, with its great,
sombre poplars, but the castle kept itself angrily and
contemptuously hidden from the chapel behind their
dense greenery. Only when the southwest wind rose
from the reed-beds and descended upon the island
did the sighing poplars sway aside and the castle
windows gleam between them, allowing the castle
to cast dark glances at the little chapel. Both were
corpses now. The castle&#8217;s eyes were dim and no
longer reflected the rays of the setting sun; the
chapel&#8217;s roof had fallen in, and, in place of its
sonorous, high-toned copper bell, the screech owls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
now raised their evil, midnight voices among its
rafters.</p>

<p>But the old, historic gulf that had, in former
times, divided the proud, lordly castle from the bourgeois
dissenting chapel, continued even after their
death, kept open by the worms that had burrowed
into the crumbling corpses and had occupied the
safest corners of their vaults and cellars. The coffin-worms
infesting these lifeless buildings were men.</p>

<p>There had been a time when the ancient castle had
served as a free refuge without restrictions of any
kind for every poor wretch that needed it. Every
one who could find no shelter in the town, every poor
creature that had fallen on evil days and had lost, for
one reason or another, the power to pay even the few
copecks needed for a roof and fire by night and in
stormy weather&mdash;all these poor wretches found their
way to the island, and there hid their vanquished
heads among the gloomy, threatening, tottering
ruins, paying for the hospitality they found there
only by the danger they ran of being buried alive
under a pile of d&eacute;bris. &#8220;He lives in the castle&#8221; had
come to be the expression used to denote the last
stages of beggardom and civilian degradation. The
old castle gladly received and sheltered every variety
of wandering destitution: poor writers temporarily
ruined, forlorn old women, and homeless vagabonds.
These persons tore down the interior of the rotting
building, broke up its floors and ceilings, lit their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
stoves, cooked heaven knows what, and, in a word,
fulfilled in some way or another their functions of
life.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there came a day when dissension
broke out among the company roosting under the
roof of those hoary ruins. Then it was that old
Yanush, who had once been one of the Count&#8217;s smaller
&#8220;officials,&#8221; prepared a sort of gubernatorial manifesto
for himself and seized the reins of power. He
set himself to reorganise things, and for several days
such a hubbub ensued and such cries arose on the
island that it seemed at times as if the Turks had
torn themselves from their prison underground in
order to avenge themselves upon their Polish tyrants.
This Yanush sorted out the inhabitants of the ruins,
dividing the sheep from the goats. The sheep, who
remained in the castle as before, helped him to expel
the unhappy goats, who were stubborn and put up a
desperate but ineffectual resistance. When, at last,
with the silent but no less effective co&ouml;peration of
the policeman, order was once more restored on
the island it appeared that the change effected had
been distinctly aristocratic in character. Yanush
had allowed only &#8220;good Christians,&#8221; that is, Roman
Catholics, to remain in the castle, and, besides this,
most of them were either former servants or descendants
of servants of the Count&#8217;s family. They were
all either old men in long, tattered cloaks with huge
red noses, or hideous, scolding hags who still clung,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
in the last stages of destitution, to their caps and
mantles. They formed a homogeneous, closely
united, aristocratic circle that had established, as it
were, a monopoly in the trade of beggary. On week-days
these old dames and gaffers would go with prayers
on their lips from house to house of the more
prosperous townspeople, carrying gossip, complaining
of their hard lot, and pouring forth tears and
supplications; but on Sundays they would appear as
the most honoured members of those long lines that,
in Western Russia, extend from the doors of Roman
Catholic churches. There they would proudly accept
offerings in the name of the &#8220;Lord Jesus&#8221; and the
&#8220;Lady Mother of God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Attracted by the uproar and shouts that came to
us from the island during the revolution, I betook
myself thither with a few of my companions, and,
hiding behind the thick trunks of the poplars, we
watched Yanush at the head of an army of red-nosed
dotards and unsightly shrews drive out the last inhabitants
of the castle that were liable to expulsion.
Evening fell. Drops of rain were already falling
from a cloud that was hanging over the high summits
of the poplars. A few unhappy wretches, wrapping
their impossibly tattered rags about them, still
lingered about the island, piteous, confused, and
scared, and, like toads that have been poked out of
their holes by boys, tried to crawl back unnoticed
into some cranny of the castle wall. But Yanush and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the beldames drove them away with curses and cries,
threatening them with sticks and pitchforks, while
the silent policeman stood by, also grasping a stout
oaken cudgel, and preserving an armed neutrality,
although he plainly favoured the conquering party.
So this unhappy riffraff disappeared grumbling over
the bridge, leaving the island forever, until one by
one they were swallowed up in the rainy darkness
of the rapidly falling night.</p>

<p>After that memorable evening both Yanush and
the old castle, which had both, until then, impressed
me with their vague grandeur, lost all their attraction
in my eyes. Before that night I had liked to
cross over to the island and to contemplate the grey
castle walls and mossy roof, even from afar. When
the motley figures of its inmates crawled out into the
brightness of morning, yawning, coughing, and crossing
themselves in the sunlight, I had looked upon
them with a sort of reverence, as upon creatures
clothed in the same mystery that surrounded the
whole castle. &#8220;They sleep there at night,&#8221; thought
I; &#8220;they hear everything that happens when the
moon looks in at the broken windows and the wind
howls through the great halls.&#8221; I had loved to listen
to Yanush, when, with all the loquacity of seventy
years, he had taken his seat beneath a poplar tree
and told me tales of the glorious past of the dying
building. Images of this past would rise before my
childish imagination, and there would be wafted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
into my heart a solemn melancholy and a vague
sympathy for the life lived here of old inside these
dismal walls. Romantic shades of an antiquity unknown
to me would flit across my young soul as the
light shadows of clouds flit across a bright field on
a windy day.</p>

<p>But after that evening the castle and its bard
appeared to me in a new light. Meeting me the following
day near the island, Yanush called me to him and
assured me with satisfaction that &#8220;the son of such
honoured parents as mine&#8221; could now boldly visit the
island, as he would find an absolutely orderly population
upon it. He even led me by the hand up to
the very castle, but I snatched my hand out of his
almost in tears, and ran away as fast as my legs could
carry me; the castle had become odious to me. The
windows of the upper story had been boarded up,
while the lower floor was ruled over by the &#8220;mantles
and caps.&#8221; The old women crawled out, looking so
unattractive, fawning upon me so mawkishly, and at
the same time scolding one another so loudly that I
honestly wondered how the old Count who was wont
to discipline his Turks on stormy nights could stand
having these old crones so near him. But chiefly I
could not forget the cold ruthlessness with which the
triumphant inhabitants of the castle had driven away
their unfortunate fellow-inmates, and my heart contracted
at the remembrance of the poor creatures left
without a roof over their heads.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>However this may be, the old castle taught me
for the first time the great fact that, from the sublime
to the ridiculous is but a step. That which
was sublime in the castle was all overgrown with convolvulus
and ivy, and that which was ridiculous was
revolting to me, and wounded my childish susceptibility
too keenly for me to feel the irony of the contrast;
this was still inaccessible to me.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p class="caption">QUEER CHARACTERS</p>

<p>The nights following the revolution on the island
were passed by the town in great anxiety. Dogs
barked, house doors creaked, and the citizens kept
emerging into the streets, knocking on the fences with
sticks, and letting every one know how valiant they
were. The town knew that a band of shivering and
hungry folk was roaming through the streets, cold
and wet, in the raw darkness of the rainy night, and
realising full well that only harsh feelings could exist
in the hearts of these people toward it, the town
put itself on guard and answered these sentiments
with threats. And, as if on purpose, the nights now
fell upon the earth in the midst of torrents of cold
rain, and passed away leaving low-flying clouds hanging
close above the ground. And the wind bellowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
in the heart of the evil weather, shaking the tree-tops,
thundering against the walls, and chanting to
me in my bed of the dozens of human creatures deprived
of warmth, with no roof over their heads.</p>

<p>But at last spring triumphed over winter&#8217;s rage;
the sun dried the wet earth, and in the meantime the
homeless wanderers had slipped away, whither, heaven
knows. The nightly barking of the dogs diminished,
the townsfolk stopped knocking on the fences, and
life assumed once more its monotonous and sleepy
aspect. The hot sun rose in the sky, scorched the
dusty streets, and drove the lively sons of Israel into
the shelter of their little booths; the &#8220;commissionaires&#8221;
lounged lazily in the sun, sharply eyeing the
passers-by and the Jewish &#8220;gesch&auml;ft&#8221;; the scratching
of official pens was heard through the open
windows of the Government buildings; the town
ladies wandered up and down the bazaars in the
mornings with baskets on their arms, and in the
evenings came out walking majestically, leaning upon
the arms of their spouses, stirring up the street dust
with the full trains of their dresses. The old men
and women from the castle decorously made the
round of their patrons without disturbing the universal
harmony. The townsfolk gladly recognised
their right to existence, and considered it absolutely
proper that some people should receive alms every
Saturday, while the denizens of the castle accepted
this charity with the utmost respectability.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>Only the unfortunate exiles now found no protection
in the town. It is true they no longer roamed
the streets at night, and people said they had taken
refuge somewhere on the hill near the dissenting
chapel, but how they had managed to find a dwelling
place there no one could exactly say. All saw, however,
the most impossible and suspicious-looking figures
in the world climb down every morning from the
cliffs on which the chapel stood and disappear again
at twilight in the same direction. These people disturbed
the quiet, sleepy life of the town by their
appearance, standing out like sombre stains against
the grey background of village life. The citizens
looked at them askance with feelings of hostility and
alarm, while they, on the other hand, watched the
village with furtively attentive eyes that sent cold
chills running down the back of many a townsman.
These persons did not resemble in any way the aristocratic
mendicants from the castle; the town did not
recognise them and they did not ask for recognition.
Their relations with the community were purely war-like
in character; they preferred cursing a townsman
to flattering him; they preferred taking things themselves
to asking for them. Nevertheless, as often
happens among a sombre mass of unfortunates, there
were those among them who, for brains and talent,
would have been an honour to the more select society
of the castle, but who had been discontented there,
and preferred the more democratic life of the dissenting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
chapel. A few of these poor creatures
were distinguished by characteristics of profoundest
tragedy.</p>

<p>I remember vividly to this day how merrily the
street would hum as the melancholy, stooping figure
of the old &#8220;Professor&#8221; walked along it. He was a
gentle being, oppressed by a clouded intelligence,
and he wore an old frieze overcoat and a wide-brimmed
hat trimmed with a faded cockade. His
learned title he had appropriated, it seemed, because
of a vague tradition that he had once, somehow,
somewhere, been a tutor. It would be hard to imagine
a creature more mild and harmless. He could
generally be seen wandering about the streets with
dim eyes and head sunk forward on his breast. The
ingenious townsfolk knew two peculiarities of his
which they made use of to procure a cruel
enjoyment for themselves. The Professor was always
muttering something to himself and no one
could ever make out what he was saying. His words
would trickle after one another with the troubled
murmur of a little brooklet, while he fixed his vague
eyes upon his listener&#8217;s face as if he were trying to
convey to that man&#8217;s mind the elusive meaning of his
long discourses. He could be wound up like a clock,
and to do this it was only necessary for one of the
lanky commissionaires dozing on the sidewalk to
call the old man to him and ask him some question.
The Professor would shake his head, pensively fix his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
faded eyes upon the face of his interlocutor, and
begin to murmur something sorrowful without an
end. Thereupon his questioner could calmly walk
away or go to sleep, and when he woke he would still
be certain to see over him that dark, melancholy figure,
murmuring his unintelligible phrases. But, naturally,
this situation was not, in itself, particularly
interesting. It was the second of the Professor&#8217;s
characteristics that enabled the louts of the street-corners
to procure their most striking effects. The
unhappy man could never hear sharp or pointed instruments
mentioned without emotion. And so, at
the very height of his unintelligible eloquence, his
listener would suddenly jump up and scream in a
harsh voice: &#8220;Knives, scissors, needles, pins!&#8221; Then
the poor old man, interrupted in the midst of his
reverie, would throw up his arms with the gesture of
a wounded bird, and stare about him in terror with
his hands clutching at his breast. Ah, how many
sufferings are incomprehensible to lanky commissionaires
because the sufferers cannot express their pain
by means of a lusty blow! But the poor Professor
would only look about him in deep distress, and
his inexpressible suffering could be divined from his
voice as he turned his clouded eyes upon his tormentor
and cried, convulsively tearing at his breast:</p>

<p>&#8220;A hook&mdash;a hook in my heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was probably trying to say that his heart had
been rent by the townsman&#8217;s exclamation, but naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
it was his very circumstance that had served
to dispel somewhat the tedium of the street loafer.
So the poor Professor would hurry away, his head
bowed even lower than before, as if he feared a blow,
and loud peals of laughter would pursue him as the
pert townsfolk ran out into the street, filling the air
with screams like the blows of a lash and shouting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Knives, scissors, needles, pins!&#8221;</p>

<p>In justice to the exiles from the castle, it must be
said that they always stood loyally by one another,
and if two or three of Turkevich&#8217;s tatterdemalions,
or, more especially, if the retired grenadier Zausailov
descended upon the Professor&#8217;s pursuers at such a
time a cruel punishment always overtook a large
number of that crowd. Zausailov, who was the
possessor of a huge frame, a purplish blue nose, and
fiercely protruding eyes, had long since declared
war on every living being, and recognised neither
treaties nor neutrality. Each time that he met the
Professor with the rabble in pursuit his angry shouts
would fill the air then and long after, as he swept
through the streets like Tamerlane, destroying everything
that stood in the way of his redoubtable progress.
Thus he practised &#8220;pogroms&#8221; on the Jews on
a large scale long before they had begun to break out
elsewhere. He would torture every Jew that fell a
prisoner into his hands and wreak insults on
the Hebrew ladies until at last the expedition of the
bold grenadier would come to an end in the gaol,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
where he was invariably domiciled after his bloody
bouts with the populace in which both sides always
manifested no small amount of valour.</p>

<p>The other individual the sight of whose misfortunes
and downfall was a source of great amusement to
the people, was Lavrovski, a retired and absolutely
drink-sodden Civil Servant. The inhabitants of the
town could easily remember the time when Lavrovski
was never spoken of as anything but &#8220;My Lord the
Secretary&#8221;; when he went about in a uniform with
brass buttons, his neck swathed in handkerchiefs of
the most marvellous hues. It is likely that this circumstance
lent an additional piquancy to the contemplation
of his present state. The change in Lavrovski&#8217;s
life had come swiftly; it had sufficed for a certain
brilliant officer of dragoons to come to Kniazh Gorodok
and live there for two weeks. In that time he
succeeded in winning and carrying off a golden-haired
lady, the rich inn-keeper&#8217;s daughter. The inhabitants
of the town never heard of the beautiful
Anna again, for she had sunk forever beneath their
horizon. And so Lavrovski was left with all his
bright-hued handkerchiefs, but without the hope that
had once embellished the life of the little official. It
was long since he had ceased to be a Civil Servant.
Somewhere, in some remote village, there lived a family
whose hope and mainstay he had once been, but
he had lost all care for anything now. In his rare
sober moments he would walk swiftly through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
streets with downcast eyes, looking at no one, as
if he were overcome with shame at the fact of his
own existence. Ragged, dirty, with long, unkempt
hair, he was always a prominent figure in a crowd,
and attracted universal attention to himself, but
he seemed never to notice any one, or to hear anything.
Only occasionally would he cast a wild
look of bewilderment about him, as much as to say:
&#8220;What do these strangers want of me? What have I
done to them, and why do they follow me so persistently
with their mockery?&#8221; If, during one of
these flashes of consciousness, his ear caught the
name of the lady with the golden hair a tempestuous
fury would rise in his heart, his eyes would shine in his
pale face with dark fire, and he would throw himself
upon the crowd of his tormentors, which would then
quickly disperse. These flashes of anger, rare as they
were, strangely provoked the interest of the loafers
who found that time hung heavily on their hands,
and it is no wonder, then, that when Lavrovski walked
down the street with downcast eyes, the rabble that
followed him should try to rouse him from his apathy,
and at last begin to throw mud and stones at him.</p>

<p>When Lavrovski was drunk he would obstinately
seek out dark fence-corners and swampy meadows and
other such extraordinary places, and there he would
sit, his long legs stretched out in front of him, his
poor grey head sunk on his breast. Solitude and
vodka awoke in him a flow of expansiveness and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
desire to pour forth the sorrow of his heavy heart,
so he would embark upon endless stories of his ruined
youth, addressing himself now to the grey posts of
the ancient fence, now to the birch trees indulgently
whispering something over his head, now to the magpies
that came hopping up to his gloomy figure with
feminine curiosity.</p>

<p>If any of us little boys succeeded in tracking him
to such a place we would silently surround him and
listen with beating hearts to his long and terrible
stories. Our hair would stand on end as we gazed
with horror at that pale creature accusing himself
of every crime under the sun. According to
Lavrovski&#8217;s own account he had killed his father,
driven his mother into the grave, and brought disgrace
on his brothers and sisters. We had no reason
for not believing these fearful confessions, and were
only surprised that Lavrovski seemed to have had
several fathers; he had thrust a sword into the heart
of one, another he had killed with slow poison, a third
he had dragged down with him into some abyss or
other. So we would listen, overwhelmed with sympathy
and horror, until Lavrovski&#8217;s tongue became
more and more entangled and at last ceased to be
able to pronounce articulate sounds; merciful sleep
would then put an end to the outpouring of his
confessions.</p>

<p>The grown people laughed at us and told us that
these stories were all moonshine, and that Lavrovski&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
parents had died a natural death from sickness or
starvation. But our tender, childish hearts heard
the cries of genuine affliction in his groans, and, taking
the allegories of the unhappy man literally, we
came nearer than our elders to understanding the
tragic wrecking of his life.</p>

<p>When Lavrovski&#8217;s head had sunk lower than ever
and snores, broken by nervous sobs, came from his
throat, we would lean our little heads over the poor
man. We would peer into his face and watch the
shadows of his misdeeds flitting across it even in his
sleep; we would see his brows contract convulsively
and his lips tighten in a piteous, almost childishly
plaintive grimace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221; he once shrieked suddenly, conscious
of a vague uneasiness caused by our presence,
and at this we scattered like a flock of startled
birds.</p>

<p>It sometimes happened that rain fell on him sleeping
thus, dust covered him, and several times in the
autumn he was literally buried in snow. If he did not
die an untimely death, he without doubt owed this to
the care which other unfortunates like himself took of
his pitiful person. Especially did he owe his life to
the jolly Turkevich, who would search him out, pull
him up, set him on his feet, and take him away with
him.</p>

<p>Turkevich belonged to the class of people, who,
as he himself expressed it, do not spit in their own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
porridge, and while the Professor and Lavrovski were
passive sufferers, he presented the appearance of a
person who was happy and fortunate in many ways.
To begin with, he had suddenly announced that he
was a general without asking the assent of any one,
and demanded that the townsfolk should call him by
that honourable title. As no one dared to question
his right to it, Turkevich very soon became imbued
with a belief in his own greatness. He always stalked
along very majestically, knitting his brows severely,
and displaying a perfect readiness to break any one&#8217;s
jaw, which last act he evidently considered the special
prerogative of a general. If his care free brain was
ever visited for a moment by doubts on the score of
his title, he would catch the first man he saw on the
street and sternly ask him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who am I, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;General Turkevich!&#8221; the man would answer
meekly, feeling himself in an awkward position,
whereupon Turkevich would slowly release him and
proudly twirl his whiskers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ex-actly!&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he had, beside all this, a very special way
of twirling his beetling moustache and an inexhaustible
fund of quaint sayings and witticisms, it was not
surprising that he was constantly surrounded by a
crowd of lively listeners. Even the doors of the best
restaurants, where the landholders of the country assembled
to play billiards, were open to him. To tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
the truth, however, it not infrequently happened that
General Turkevich would come flying out of them
with the alacrity of a man who is being shoved rather
unceremoniously from behind. But these incidents,
which he explained by the lack of respect the landholders
had for wit, had no effect upon Turkevich&#8217;s
general frame of mind. A state of happy self-confidence
and continual intoxication&mdash;that was his normal
condition.</p>

<p>In this last circumstance lay the second key to his
felicity; one glass of vodka was enough to keep him
fuddled for a day. This fact people explained by the
immense quantity which Turkevich had already
drunk, and which was said to have converted his
blood into a solution of vodka. All that was necessary
now was for the General to bring this solution
to a proper strength, for it to ripple and rush
through his veins, painting the world for him with
rainbow tints.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, for one reason or another,
the General could not procure a glass of vodka for
a day or two, he would suffer the most excruciating
torture. First he would fall into a fit of melancholy
and low spirits. All knew that at these times the
terrible General was more helpless than a child, and
many hastened to wreak vengeance upon him then
for insults received. They would beat him and spit
upon him and cover him with mud, while he would not
even try to run away from the disgrace, but would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
bellow at the top of his lungs while the tears streamed
in torrents down his long, drooping moustache. The
poor wretch would turn to every one, imploring them
to kill him; saying that, anyhow, he was doomed to
die a dog&#8217;s death in a fence corner. At that every
one would stand aside, for there was something in the
voice and face of the General at those times which
sent even his most determined enemies away as fast
as their legs could carry them. They could not
bear to see the face, to hear the voice of a man who,
for an instant, was conscious of the appalling tragedy
of his lot.</p>

<p>Then another change would come over the General
and he would grow terrible to look at. His eyes
would flash feverishly, his cheeks would cave in, his
short hair would bristle on his head, he would go off
into a kind of frenzy, and, rising to his feet, would
stalk triumphantly through the streets, beating his
breast and announcing to every one in a loud voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going! Like Jeremiah, I am going to denounce
the ungodly!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was always the signal for an interesting scene.</p>

<p>It may safely be said that Turkevich played the
part of a famous person in our little town, so it
was small wonder that the sedatest and busiest of our
townsmen should drop their work and mingle with
the rabble at the heels of the new prophet, or that at
least they should watch his progress from afar. He
usually went first to the Secretary of the County<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
Court, and before his house he would hold something
like a session of court, choosing suitable members of
the crowd to take the parts of the plaintiff and the
defendant. He himself would make the pleas and
reply to them, mimicking very skilfully the voice and
manner of a prisoner.</p>

<p>As he was always able to give a contemporary
flavour to his performances by alluding to some fact
well known to all, and as he was extremely well versed
in the procedures of a court room, it was not surprising
that the Secretary&#8217;s cook should come flying
out of the house in a twinkling, touch Turkevich on
the arm, and hastily disappear, repulsing as she went
the attentions of Turkevich&#8217;s followers. Turkevich
would laugh sardonically on receiving this gift, and,
waving the money triumphantly, would retire to the
nearest tavern.</p>

<p>Having slightly slaked his thirst there, he would
continue to lead his audience from house to house of
those whom he &#8220;denounced,&#8221; varying his programme
to suit each particular case. As he always received
money for each performance, his fierce tone would
gradually become more mild, his moustache would begin
to curl once more, and the denunciatory drama
gradually became a merry vaudeville that generally
ended in front of the house where Kotz, the Captain
of Police, lived. Kotz was the most kindly of all the
city officials and had only two little weaknesses: he
dyed his grey hair black and had a partiality for fat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
cooks. In everything else he showed an implicit
confidence in the will of God and the &#8220;gratitude&#8221; of
the townsfolk. Having arrived in front of the Police
Captain&#8217;s house, Turkevich would wink gaily at his
companions, throw up his cap, and announce in
stentorian tones that not the Police Captain lived
here, but Turkevich&#8217;s own father and benefactor.</p>

<p>Then he would fix his eyes on the windows and await
results. The consequence was always one of two
things: either the fat, red-cheeked Matriona would
come running out of the front door with a present
from Turkevich&#8217;s &#8220;father and benefactor,&#8221; or the
door would remain closed, and Turkevich would
catch sight at a window of an angry old face in a
frame of coal-black hair, while Matriona would creep
through back ways to the police station. There the
cobbler Mikita, who made a very good living out
of these very affairs with Turkevich, was always sitting.
On seeing Matriona he would immediately
throw down his boot-last and rise from his seat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Turkevich, seeing that no good results
followed his dithyrambs, would, little by little, cautiously
have recourse to satire. He would usually
begin by remarking what a pity it was that his benefactor
thought it necessary to dye his honourable
grey hair with shoe blacking. Next, grieved by the
absolute lack of attention which his eloquence received,
he would raise his voice and begin to assail
his benefactor as a melancholy example of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
man living illegally with Matriona. By the time he
reached this delicate subject, the General had always
lost all hope of reconciliation with his &#8220;benefactor,&#8221;
and would therefore arm himself with all the genuine
eloquence of indignation. It was a pity that an unexpected
interruption almost always came at this
point in his speech. Kotz&#8217;s angry yellow face would
appear thrust out of one of the windows of his house,
and Mikita, who had crept up with marvellous dexterity,
would seize Turkevich from behind. No member
of his audience ever tried to warn the orator of
his approaching danger, for Mikita&#8217;s artistic methods
always called forth universal admiration. Cut off in
the midst of a word, the General would suddenly whirl
through the air and find himself upside down on Mikita&#8217;s
back. A few seconds more, and the sturdy cobbler
would be quietly making his way to the gaol,
bending slightly beneath his burden, and followed by
the deafening shouts of the populace. Another minute,
and the black door of the police station would
gape like a pair of forbidding jaws and the General
would disappear into the darkness, helplessly kicking
his feet. The thankless mob would cry, &#8220;Hurrah
for Mikita!&#8221; and gradually melt away.</p>

<p>Beside these individuals who were conspicuous
among the ranks of the vagabonds, a dark crew of
pitiful, ragged creatures had taken refuge near the
chapel, and these never failed to create intense excitement
by their appearance at the bazaars. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
merchants would hastily seek to protect their goods
with their hands, as a hen covers her brood when a
hawk appears in the sky above her. There was a
rumour afloat that these poor wretches had formed
a fraternal organisation and that now, since they had
been deprived of their last resources by their expulsion
from the castle, they occupied themselves with
petty thieving in the town and its environs. Such
rumours were chiefly founded on the fact that a man
cannot live without bread, and as all the suspicious
persons had in some way or other abandoned the
normal way of obtaining it, and had been cut off
from the benefits of local charity, it was naturally
concluded that they must either steal or die. As they
did not die, the very fact of their remaining alive was
evidence of their guilty practices.</p>

<p>If this was true, it was no less apparent that the
organiser and leader of the band could be no other
than Tiburtsi Drab, the most remarkable of all the
queer characters that had lost their home in the castle.</p>

<p>Drab&#8217;s origin was shrouded in the most mystifying
uncertainty. Those who were gifted with a vivid
imagination credited him with having an aristocratic
name which he had brought to shame; he was therefore
obliged to conceal himself, at the same time taking
part, it was said, in the exploits of the notorious
Karmeliuk. But, in the first place, he was not old
enough for this, and, in the second place, Tiburtsi&#8217;s
appearance did not present one single aristocratic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
feature. He was tall, and his heavily stooping shoulders
seemed to tell of great burdens borne by the
unfortunate man. His large features were coarsely
expressive. His short, reddish hair bristled stiffly all
over his head; his receding forehead, his slightly projecting
lower jaw, and the rapid play of his facial
muscles lent something apish to his face, but the eyes
that sparkled under his beetling brows were determined
and dark, and there shone in them, beside
cunning, a keen perspicacity, energy, and an uncommon
intelligence. While his features were changing
under the kaleidoscopic play of his expressions, his
eyes would retain their same fixed, unvarying look,
and for this reason the buffoonery of the strange man
filled me with unreasoning dread.</p>

<p>Tiburtsi&#8217;s hands were callous and rough, and he
stamped his great feet like a peasant. Therefore
the consensus of opinion among the townsfolk was
that he was not of aristocratic birth, and the most
they would concede was that he might have been the
servant of a great family. But here another difficulty
presented itself: how, then, explain the phenomenal
learning that every one unanimously admitted
he possessed? It was impossible not to acknowledge
this obvious fact, for there was not a
tavern in the whole town where Tiburtsi had not
stood on a barrel and spouted whole speeches from
Cicero and Xenophon for the benefit of the Little
Russians collected there on market days. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
Little Russians would gape and nudge one another
with their elbows, while Tiburtsi, towering above
them in his rags, would thunder forth Catilinus or
paint the exploits of C&aelig;sar and the craft of Mithridates.
Little Russians are, by nature, endowed with
a glowing fancy, and these were able to read their
own meaning into Tiburtsi&#8217;s fiery if unintelligible
speeches. When the orator beat his breast and
turned to them with flashing eyes, exclaiming:
&#8220;Patres Conscripti!&#8221; they too would knit their
brows and say to one another:</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha, the son of a gun, he does bark!&#8221;</p>

<p>Later, when Tiburtsi would raise his eyes to the
ceiling and begin declaiming endless verses of Latin
poetry, his whiskered audience would follow every
word he uttered with timid and pitying sympathy.
They felt as if the soul of their orator were soaring
somewhere in an unknown region where people
did not talk like Christians, and by his despairing
gestures they concluded that it was there meeting
with the most sorrowful adventures. But this sympathetic
tension reached its height whenever Tiburtsi
rolled up his eyes so that only the whites were visible
and wrung his audience&#8217;s heart with endless recitations
from Virgil and from Homer. Such hollow,
sepulchral tones would then shake his voice that
those who sat farthest away and were most under the
influence of the Jewish &#8220;gorelka&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> would hang their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
heads until their long top-knots dangled before them,
and begin to sob:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, little mother, how sad it is!&#8221; while the
tears would flow from their eyes and trickle piteously
down their long whiskers.</p>

<p>This learning of the queer fellow&#8217;s made it necessary
to invent a new hypothesis about him which
should tally more closely with the obvious facts. It
was at last agreed that Tiburtsi had once been
the house-boy of a count who had sent him to a
Jesuit school with his own son, desiring that he
should clean the young gentleman&#8217;s boots. It appeared,
however, that the young count had received
most of the blows of the holy fathers&#8217; three-tailed
&#8220;disciplinarian,&#8221; while the servant had appropriated
the learning intended for the head of his master.</p>

<p>As a result of the mystery which surrounded Tiburtsi,
he was credited among other things with having
an intimate knowledge of witchcraft. If a
&#8220;witch-ball&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> suddenly appeared in the billowy
fields that closed like a sea about the last hovels of
the town, no one could pull it up with less danger
to himself and to the reapers than Tiburtsi. If an
owl settled in the evening on some one&#8217;s roof and,
with loud cries, summoned death to the house, Tiburtsi
would be sent for and would drive the ill-omened
bird away by reciting quotations from Livy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>No one could even conjecture how Tiburtsi happened
to have children, and yet the fact was obvious;
there were even two facts, a boy of seven, unusually
well-grown and intelligent for his age, and a little
girl of three. Tiburtsi had led, or rather carried,
the boy with him during the early days of his appearance
over our horizon. As for the little girl, he
had seemed to vanish for several months into an absolutely
unknown place in order to procure her.</p>

<p>The boy, whose name was Valek, was tall and thin
and dark. He might sometimes be seen sauntering
gloomily about the town with his hands in his pockets,
casting sidelong glances about him without having
anything in particular to do, and was the cause of
many a palpitating heart to the bakers.</p>

<p>The little girl was only seen once or twice, borne
aloft in Tiburtsi&#8217;s arms. She then disappeared and
no one knew whither she had gone.</p>

<p>People spoke of certain subterranean passages on
the hill near the dissenting chapel, and such places
were not uncommon in that part of Russia, over
which the Tartars had so often swept with fire and
sword, where Polish licence had run high, and where
the fierce heroes of the old Ukraine had held their
bloody tribunals. So every one believed in the existence
of these caves, especially as it was clear that the
band of poor unfortunates must be living somewhere.
They always disappeared toward evening in precisely
the direction of the chapel. Thither the Professor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
hobbled with his drowsy gait; thither strode Tiburtsi,
swiftly and resolutely; thither staggered Turkevich,
leading the fierce and helpless Lavrovski; thither
went a crowd of other suspicious creatures, and vanished
into the darkness of night. There was no man
brave enough to follow them up the slippery clay
landslides that clothed the hillside. The hill, which
was honeycombed with graves, enjoyed an evil reputation.
Blue flames might be seen burning in the old
cemetery in the dusk of autumn nights, and the
screech owls hooted so shrilly and loudly in the
chapel that even the blacksmith&#8217;s fearless heart would
quail when the cries of the accursed birds came to his
ears.</p>

<p class="caption">MY FATHER AND I</p>

<p>&#8220;This is bad, young man, bad!&#8221; old Yanush used
often to say, meeting me in the street in Turkevich&#8217;s
train or among Tiburtsi&#8217;s audience.</p>

<p>And as he said this the old man would wag his
grey beard.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is bad, young man; you are in bad company.
It is a pity, a very great pity to see the
son of such honourable parents among them.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, since my mother had died
and my father&#8217;s gloomy face had become even more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
sombre than before, I was very seldom seen at home.
I used to creep into the garden like a young wolf
in the late summer evenings, carefully avoid a
meeting with my father, open my window which was
half-concealed by lilac bushes, and slip silently into
bed. If my little sister was not asleep in her cradle
in the next room I used to go in to see her, and we
would softly kiss one another and play together,
taking care not to wake our grumbling old nurse.</p>

<p>In the morning, at break of day, while every one
else in the house was still asleep, I was already tracing
a dewy pathway through the tall grass of our
garden, jumping across the fence, and making my
way to the pond where my madcap companions would
be waiting for me with fishing rods. Or else I would
go down to the mill where the sleepy miller would
have opened the sluices a few moments before, and
where the water, its glassy surface delicately quivering,
would already be plunging down the mill-race,
going bravely on its way to its daily toil.</p>

<p>The big mill-wheels, roused by the water&#8217;s noisy
blows, would quiver too and seem to yield unwillingly,
as if loath to forego their sleep, but next
moment they would be turning, splashing the foam
about, and bathing themselves in the cold torrent.</p>

<p>Behind them the shafts would slowly begin to revolve;
inside the mill pinions would rattle, millstones
would whirr, and a white floury dust would rise in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
clouds through the cracks of the venerable building.</p>

<p>Then I would run on&mdash;I loved to meet Nature at
her awakening. I was glad when I succeeded in
rousing a sleepy lark or in startling a timid hare
from its form. The dew-drops would be dripping
from the maiden-hair and from the faces of the
meadow flowers as I crossed the fields on my way
to the woods beyond the town. The trees would greet
me with a drowsy murmur. The pale, surly faces
of the prisoners would not yet be peering from the
windows of the gaol, and only the sentry would
be walking around its walls, noisily rattling his
rifle as he relieved the tired night-watchman.</p>

<p>Although I had made a long round, when I reached
the town again I would still meet sleepy figures
here and there, opening the shutters of the houses.
But when the sun rose over the hill, a rackety bell
would ring out across the ponds calling the school-boys
together, and hunger would drive me home to
my morning tea.</p>

<p>Every one called me a tramp and a young good-for-nothing,
and I was on the whole so often reproached
with my many wicked tendencies, that
at last I came to be persuaded of them myself. My
father believed in them too, and sometimes made
an effort to take my education in hand, but these
attempts invariably ended in failure. The sight of
his stern, melancholy face on which lay the harsh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
imprint of inconsolable grief frightened me and drove
me into myself. I would stand uneasily before him,
first on one foot and then on the other, glancing
about me, and plucking at my little breeches. Sometimes
I seemed to feel something rising in my breast;
I wanted him to kiss me and take me on his knee.
I should then have nestled to his breast and perhaps
we should have wept together&mdash;the stern man and
the child&mdash;at the thought of our common loss. But
he would look at me instead with dim eyes that
seemed to be staring at something over my head,
and I would shrink under that gaze, which was incomprehensible
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember your mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>Did I remember her? Ah, yes, I remembered! I
remembered how, in the night, I used to awaken and,
finding her soft arms in the darkness, would nestle
near them, covering them with kisses. I remembered
her as she had sat dying at the open window,
gazing sorrowfully at the lovely Spring landscape
before her, bidding it farewell in the last year of
her life.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, I remembered her! As she lay beautiful,
young, and covered with flowers, but with the seal
of death upon her pale face, I had crouched in a
corner like a young wild thing, staring at her with
burning eyes before which the whole awful riddle
of life and death was being unfolded. And at last,
when a crowd of strangers had borne her away, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
it not my sobs that filled the house with low sounds
of weeping on the first night of my bereavement?</p>

<p>Ah yes, I remembered her! And still, in the silence
of night, I would awaken with my childish heart
bursting with an overflowing love, a smile of happiness
on my lips, in blessed forgetfulness, wrapped
in the rosy dreams of childhood. And once more
it seemed that she was with me, and that at any
moment I might feel again her gentle, loving kiss.
But my arms would reach out into the empty darkness,
and again the consciousness of my bitter loneliness
would pierce my soul. Then I would press
my hands to my aching heart and scalding tears
would trickle down my cheeks.</p>

<p>Ah yes, I remembered her! But at the question of
that tall, stern man with whom I wished to feel a
sense of kinship and could not, I would wince more
than ever, and quietly withdraw my little hand from
his.</p>

<p>And he would turn away from me with anger and
pain. He felt that he had not the slightest influence
over me, that an insurmountable barrier stood between
us. He had loved her too much while she
was alive to notice me in his happiness, and now his
deep sorrow hid me from him.</p>

<p>So little by little the gulf dividing us grew ever
wider and deeper. He became more and more convinced
that I was a wicked, worthless boy, with a
hard, selfish heart, and the feeling that he <i>should</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
but could not teach me; <i>should</i> love me, but could
not find a corner in his heart to harbour this love,
still more increased his dislike for me. And this I
felt. I used to watch him sometimes from where I
stood hidden behind the shrubbery. He would walk
up and down the garden paths with ever quickening
footsteps, groaning with the unbearable agony in
his heart. My heart too would ache with sympathy
and pity at the sight of him. Once, when he took
his head in his hands and sank down sobbing on a
bench, I could endure it no longer and ran out of
the shrubbery into the path, impelled by an undefinable
impulse to be near him.</p>

<p>But he, roused from his gloomy and hopeless meditations,
looked at me sternly and checked me with
the cold question:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not want anything. I turned quickly away,
ashamed of my outburst, afraid lest my father should
read it in my blushing face. I ran into the grove in
the garden and falling on my face in the grass wept
bitterly from vexation and pain.</p>

<p>At six years I had already experienced all the horrors
of loneliness.</p>

<p>My sister Sonia was four. I loved her passionately
and she returned my love, but the general, fixed
opinion that I was an out-and-out little rascal at
last succeeded in raising a high barrier between us.
Whenever I began to play with her in my noisy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
frolicsome way, our old nurse, always sleepy and
always picking over hen feathers for pillows with
closed eyes, would wake up in an instant, swiftly
seize my Sonia, and carry her away, throwing an
angry glance at me. At such times she always reminded
me of a ruffled brood-hen, while I likened
myself to a marauding hawk, and Sonia to a little
chicken. I would be hurt and vexed. It was no
wonder, then, that I soon abandoned all attempts
to amuse Sonia with my objectionable games, and
in a little while both our house and the little garden
began to grow irksome to me, for I found there
neither welcome nor kindness. I began to roam. My
whole being was quivering with strange presentiments;
a foretaste, as it were, of life. It seemed to
me that I should surely find something somewhere
out there, in that great, unknown world beyond the
old walled garden; I felt as if I should and would
do something, only I knew not what, and from the
bottom of my soul a feeling that tempted me and
teased me rose up to meet this mystery. I was constantly
awaiting the solution of these riddles, and
instinctively fled from our nurse and her feathers,
from the familiar, lazy whispering of the apple trees
in our little garden, and from the silly knife-blows
that resounded whenever meat was being chopped
in our kitchen. From then on the epithets of &#8220;street
urchin&#8221; and &#8220;tramp&#8221; were added to my other unflattering
appellations. But I paid no heed to this;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
I had grown accustomed to reproaches, and endured
them as I endured sudden downpours of rain
and the fierce heat of the sun. I listened scowling to
all rebukes and went my own way. Wandering
through the streets, I watched the life of the town
with childishly inquiring eyes; I listened to the
rumbling of the wagons on the highway and tried
to catch the echoes of great far-away cities, either
in the clatter of their wheels or in the whispering
of the wind among the tall Cossack tombs by the
roadside. More than once did my eyes open wide
with fear, more than once did my heart stop beating
at the panorama of life unfolding before me,
picture after picture, impression after impression,
each leaving a vivid imprint on my heart. I saw
and knew a great deal that children much older than
myself ordinarily never see, and all the while that unexplained
something which had risen from the depths
of my childish soul called to me as before, ceaseless,
mysterious, vibrant.</p>

<p>After the shrews of the castle had deprived the old
building of my respect and admiration, and when
every corner of the town had become familiar to
me down to the last filthy alley, then I began to turn
my eyes into the distance, toward the hill on which
the dissenting chapel stood. At first I approached
it from one side and then from another like a timid
animal, not daring to climb a hill that had such an
evil reputation. But as I gradually grew more familiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
with the place, I began to see before me only
peaceful graves and fallen crosses. Nowhere were
there any visible signs of life or of the presence of
human beings. It lay quiet, deserted and alone.
Only the chapel frowned at me with its empty windows,
as if absorbed in melancholy meditation. I
longed to inspect the building from every point of
view, to look inside it, and so to make sure that
there was nothing in it but dust. But it was both
terrifying and inconvenient to undertake such an
expedition alone, and so I enlisted a small army of
three scape-graces, urchins who were attracted to
the adventure by the promise of cakes and of apples
from our garden.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="caption">I MAKE SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES</p>

<p>We started on our expedition one day after dinner,
and, having reached the hill, began climbing
the clay landslides that had been torn from its side
by grave diggers long dead and by the freshets of
Spring. These landslides had stripped the hillside
bare, and here and there white, crumbling bones
protruded through the clay. In one place the
rotting corner of a coffin jutted out; in another a
human skull grinned at us, fixing us with its dark,
hollow eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>At last, lending one another a hand, we scrambled
up over the last cliff and found ourselves on the
summit of the hill. The sun was already nearing
the horizon. Its slanting rays were tenderly gilding
the sward of the old cemetery, playing across
its ancient, zig-zag crosses, and streaming through
the windows of the chapel. The air was still, and
about us reigned the deep peace of a deserted
burial ground. Here we no longer saw skulls and
shank-bones and coffins. A soft, gently sloping
carpet of fresh green grass had lovingly concealed
in its embrace the horror and ugliness of death.</p>

<p>We were alone. Only the sparrows were bustling
merrily about us, and a few swallows were silently
flying in and out of the windows of the chapel standing
disconsolately among its grassy graves, modest
crosses, and the tumble-down stone sepulchres on
the d&eacute;bris of which gleamed the bright faces of
butter-cups, violets, and clover blossoms.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one is here,&#8221; said one of my companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sun is setting,&#8221; added another, looking at
the sun, which, although it had not yet set, was
hanging low above the hill.</p>

<p>The doors and windows were boarded up for some
distance above the ground, but, with the help of my
companions, I had hopes of scaling them and peeping
into the chapel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; cried one of my band, suddenly losing
his courage and seizing my arm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>&#8220;Get away, you old woman!&#8221; the oldest of our little
army shouted at him, deftly offering me his back.</p>

<p>I jumped bravely upon it; he stood up, and I
found myself with my feet on his shoulders. In this
position I could easily reach the window-sill with my
hand. I made sure of its strength, and then pulled
myself up and sat on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you see?&#8221; the boys asked from
below, with lively curiosity.</p>

<p>I was silent. By peering over the sill I could
see down into the interior of the chapel, from whence
there rose to meet me all the solemn quiet of an
abandoned place of worship. The interior of the
tall, narrow building was innocent of paint. The
evening sunlight was streaming unobstructed through
the open windows, staining the peeling walls a brilliant
gold. I saw the inside of the closed door,
the crumbling gallery, the ancient tottering columns.
The distance from the window to the floor appeared
much greater than from the window to the grass outside.
I seemed to be looking down into a deep abyss,
and at first I could not make out what certain
strange objects were whose fantastic forms were
resting upon the floor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my friends were growing weary of
standing below waiting for me to give them news,
and one of them climbed up by the same method
that I had employed, and took his seat beside me,
holding on to the window frame.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s the altar,&#8221; he said, looking down at one
of the strange objects on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s the lustre.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s the little table for the Bible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but what&#8217;s that?&#8221; I asked, pointing to the
dark shape that lay beside the altar.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a priest&#8217;s hat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s a bucket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would they have used a bucket for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To carry coals for the incense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it certainly is a hat. Anyhow, we can find
out!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Here, let&#8217;s tie your belt to the window-sill,
and you can let yourself down by it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like that! Let yourself down if you want to!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I wouldn&#8217;t go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on then!&#8221;</p>

<p>Acting on impulse I tied the two belts together,
slipped them under the window-sill, and, giving one
end to my companion, let myself down by the other.
I trembled as my feet touched the floor, but a glance
at my friend&#8217;s face bending sympathetically over me
reassured me. The sound of my heels rang out under
the ceiling, resounding in the chapel&#8217;s void, and
echoing among its dark corners. A few sparrows
started up from their roosts in the gallery and fluttered
out through a large hole in the roof. All at
once I caught sight of a stern, bearded face under a
crown of thorns looking down at me from over the
window in which we had been sitting. It was an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
immense crucifix leaning out from high up under
the rafters.</p>

<p>I was seized with dread. My companion&#8217;s eyes
sparkled, and he held his breath with curiosity and
sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going any farther?&#8221; he asked in a low
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered in the same tone, summoning
all my courage, but at that instant something totally
unexpected happened. First, we heard the rattle
of plaster falling in the gallery. Then something
moved overhead, stirring up clouds of dust, and a big
grey mass flapped its wings and rose to the hole in
the roof. The chapel was darkened in a moment.
A huge old owl, frightened out of a dark corner by
our noise, hung poised for a moment in the aperture
with outstretched wings, and then sailed away.</p>

<p>A wave of shuddering fear passed over me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull me up!&#8221; I cried to my playmate, and seized
the strap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be frightened!&#8221; he answered soothingly and
prepared to pull me up into the sunshine and the
light of day.</p>

<p>But all at once I saw his face become distorted
with alarm. He screamed, jumped down from the
window-sill, and vanished in an instant. I instinctively
looked behind me, and caught sight of a
strange apparition which filled me, however, more
with surprise than terror.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>The dark object that had been the subject of our
dispute, and that had first looked like a bucket, then
like a hat, and then at last like a kettle, suddenly
flashed across my vision and vanished behind the
altar. All I could distinguish was the dim outline
of a small, what seemed to be a child&#8217;s, hand, beckoning
the object into its hiding place.</p>

<p>It would be hard to describe my sensations at that
moment. They were not painful, the feeling that
overcame me could not even be called fear. I seemed
to be in another world. From somewhere, as if
from the world that I had left, there came to me,
a few seconds later, the swift frightened pattering of
three pairs of children&#8217;s feet. This sound soon died
away, and I was left alone in that tomb-like place,
in the presence of an apparition inexplicable and
strange.</p>

<p>Time ceased to exist for me, therefore I cannot
say whether it was soon or not before I was aware
of suppressed whispering under the altar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t he climb up again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see, he&#8217;s frightened.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first voice seemed to be that of a very little
child, the second might have belonged to a boy of
my own age. I seemed to see, too, a pair of black
eyes shining through the chinks in the old altar.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he going to do now?&#8221; the whisper recommenced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait and see,&#8221; answered the older voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>Something moved so violently under the altar that
the structure trembled, and a little figure emerged
from underneath it.</p>

<p>It was a boy of nine, taller than I was, thin and
slight as a reed. He was dressed in a dirty shirt,
and his hands were thrust into the pockets of a pair
of short, tight breeches. His black hair hung in
shaggy elf-locks over his dark, pensive eyes.</p>

<p>Although he was a stranger and had appeared on
the scene in such an unusual and unexpected manner,
and although he was approaching me with that
infinitely provocative look with which boys always
met each other among our bazaars when they were
preparing for a fight, I nevertheless felt very much
braver than I had before. My courage increased
when there appeared from under the altar, or rather
from a trap-door in the floor which was concealed by
the altar, another grimy little face framed in golden
curls, and a pair of bright blue eyes fixed on me
full of childish curiosity.</p>

<p>I moved slightly away from the wall and also put
my hands into my pockets according to the rules of
our bazaars. This was a sign that I was not afraid
of my adversary and even partly wished to hint at
my contempt for him.</p>

<p>We stood face to face, measuring each other with
our eyes. Having stared at me from head to foot,
the boy asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;What business is it of
yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>My adversary jerked his shoulder as if he intended
to take his hand out of his pocket and strike
me. I did not blink.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you!&#8221; he threatened.</p>

<p>I stuck out my chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit me! Try!&#8221;</p>

<p>The moment was crucial. On it depended the
character of our future relationship. I waited, but
my opponent continued to fix me with the same
scrutinising gaze and did not move.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hit&mdash;too&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I said, but more peaceably
this time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the little girl, with her tiny hands resting
on the floor of the chapel, was trying to scramble
up out of the trap-door. She fell down, got up
again, and at last came tottering with uncertain
steps toward the boy. Having reached him, she
seized him and nestled closely to him, at the same
time fixing eyes of wonder and fear upon my face.</p>

<p>This decided the affair. It was obvious that the
boy could not fight under conditions such as these.
Of course I was too generous to take advantage of
the awkward situation he was in.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221; asked the boy, stroking
the little girl&#8217;s fair curls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vasia. What&#8217;s yours?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s Valek. I know you. You live in the
garden near the pond. You have big apples.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, our apples are fine. Don&#8217;t you want some?&#8221;</p>

<p>Taking out of my pocket two apples that had
been intended as payment for my shamefully fugitive
band, I gave one to Valek and held out the other
to the little girl. But she only hid her face and
pressed closer to Valek.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s frightened,&#8221; he said, and handed the apple
to the child himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you come down here for?&#8221; he asked
next. &#8220;Did I ever come into <i>your</i> garden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can come if you want to. I wish you would!&#8221;
I answered joyfully.</p>

<p>Valek was taken back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t play with you,&#8221; he answered sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; I asked, deeply grieved by the sorrowful
voice in which he had spoken these words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father is a judge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what if he is?&#8221; I asked with candid amazement.
&#8220;You&#8217;d play with me, not with my father!&#8221;</p>

<p>Valek shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tiburtsi wouldn&#8217;t let me.&#8221; And as if the name
had reminded him of something, he suddenly recollected
himself and went on: &#8220;Look here, you&#8217;re a fine
boy, but you&#8217;d better go. If Tiburtsi should find
you here it would be awful.&#8221;</p>

<p>I agreed that it was time for me to go. The last
rays of the setting sun were already fading behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
the windows of the chapel, and the town was some
distance away.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I get out of here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you. We&#8217;ll go out together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what about her?&#8221; I asked, pointing to the
little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, Marusia? She&#8217;ll come with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How? Through the window?&#8221;</p>

<p>Valek reflected a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what; I&#8217;ll help you to climb through
the window and we&#8217;ll go out another way.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the help of my new friend I climbed up to
the window-sill. Untying the belt, I slipped it
around the sill, seized both ends, and swung myself
into the air. Then, releasing one end, I dropped
to the ground and jerked down the belt. Valek and
Marusia were already waiting for me outside, at
the foot of the wall.</p>

<p>The sun had just set behind the hill. The town
was sunk in purple mist, only the tall poplars on
the island, stained by the last glow of the sunset,
stood out sharply defined in pure gold. I felt as if
I had been in the old cemetery for a day and a night;
it was as if I had come there the day before.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lovely here!&#8221; I exclaimed, struck by the freshness
of the evening and filling my lungs with the
cool, damp air.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lonely here,&#8221; said Valek sadly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>&#8220;Do you live here?&#8221; I asked, as the three of us
began to descend the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your house?&#8221;</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t imagine that children like myself could
live without a house.</p>

<p>Valek smiled in his habitual sad way and did not
answer.</p>

<p>We avoided the steep landslides, for Valek knew a
better path. Pushing through the reeds of a dry
marsh and crossing a couple of little streams on
narrow planks, we found ourselves on a flat at
the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>Here we were forced to take leave of one another.
I pressed my new friend&#8217;s hand and then
held out mine to the little girl. She gave me her
tiny paw affectionately and, looking up at me with
her blue eyes, asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll surely come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Valek thoughtfully. &#8220;You might
as well come, but only when our people are in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are your people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why our people: all of them, Tiburtsi and Lavrovski
and Turkevich and the Professor&mdash;but perhaps
he wouldn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll watch for them, and when they&#8217;re
in town, I&#8217;ll come. Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi! Listen!&#8221; Valek called after me when I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
gone a few steps. &#8220;You won&#8217;t tell any one you&#8217;ve
been here with us, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not a soul!&#8221; I answered firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. And when those idiots of yours ask
you what you saw say the Devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll say that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, then!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>The thick shades of night were descending on
Kniazh Gorodok as I approached our garden wall.
A slender crescent moon was hanging over the castle
and the sky was bright with stars. I was about to
climb the wall when some one seized my arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vasia!&#8221; my runaway friend burst out in an excited
whisper. &#8220;Is that you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know it is. And so you all ran away!&#8221;</p>

<p>He hung his head, but curiosity got the better of
his confusion and he asked again:</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you see there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think I saw?&#8221; I answered in a
voice that would not admit of a doubt; &#8220;devils, of
course. And you are all cowards!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pushing my abashed companion aside, I climbed
over the wall.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later I had sunk into a profound
slumber, and was dreaming that I was watching real
little devils merrily hopping up out of the hole in
the chapel floor. Valek was chasing them about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
with a birch twig, and Marusia, her eyes sparkling
with pleasure, was laughing and clapping her hands.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p class="caption">MY ACQUAINTANCESHIP IS CONTINUED</p>

<p>From thenceforth I became entirely absorbed in
my new acquaintances. At night as I went to bed
and on rising in the morning I thought of nothing
but my coming visit to the hill. I now wandered
about the streets for the sole purpose of ascertaining
whether the whole assemblage of what Yanush
called the &#8220;bad company&#8221; was there or not. If
Lavrovski was sprawling in the meadow and Turkevich
and Tiburtsi were holding forth to their audiences,
and if the rest of the suspicious characters
were poking about the bazaar, I immediately ran
off across the marsh and up the hill to the chapel,
having first filled my pockets with apples, which I
was allowed to pick in our garden, and with sweet-meats,
which I always saved up for my new friends.</p>

<p>Valek, who was very serious, and whose grown-up
ways inspired me with respect, would quietly accept
these gifts and generally put them aside for his
sister, but Marusia would clap her hands and her
eyes would sparkle with unaffected pleasure. The
child&#8217;s pale cheeks would glow with rosy colour and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
she would laugh, and this laugh of our little friend&#8217;s
always went straight to our hearts and rewarded us
for the sweets we had sacrificed for her sake.</p>

<p>This pale, diminutive little creature reminded one
of a flower that had blossomed without seeing the
life-giving rays of the sun. Although she was four
years old, she still walked weakly on her crooked
little legs, swaying like a grass-blade as she moved.
Her hands were transparent and thin, and her head
nodded on her neck like a bluebell on its stalk, but
her glance was, at times, so unchildlike and sad, and
her smile reminded me so of my mother&#8217;s during
her last days as she had sat at her open window
with the breeze stirring her hair, that I would often
grow sad myself at the sight of her little babyish
face, and the tears would rise in my eyes.</p>

<p>I could not help comparing her to my sister who
was the same age; the latter was as round as a
dumpling and as buoyant as a rubber ball. Sonia
ran so merrily when she was playing and laughed
so ringingly, she wore such pretty dresses, and every
day her nurse would braid a crimson ribbon into
her dark hair.</p>

<p>But my little friend hardly ever ran and very
seldom laughed; when she did her laughter sounded
like the tiniest of silver bells that ten steps away is
scarcely audible. Her dress was dirty and old, no
ribbon decked her hair, which was much longer and
thicker than Sonia&#8217;s. To my surprise, Valek knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
how to braid it very cleverly, and this he would do
every morning.</p>

<p>I was a great madcap. People used to say of me:
&#8220;That boy&#8217;s hands and feet are full of quicksilver.&#8221;
I believed this myself, although I could not understand
how and by whom the quicksilver could have
been inserted. During the first days of our friendship
I brought my high spirits into the company of
my new companions, and I doubt if the echoes of the
old chapel had ever repeated such deafening shrieks
as they did whilst I was trying to rouse and amuse
Valek and Marusia with my pranks. But in spite
of them all I did not succeed. Valek would gaze seriously
first at me and then at the little girl, and
once when I was making her run a race with me,
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that, you&#8217;ll make her cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in fact, when I had teased Marusia into running,
and when she heard my steps behind her, she
suddenly turned round, raised her arms above her
head as if to protect herself, looked at me with the
helpless eyes of a trapped bird, and burst into tears.
I was touched to the quick.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, you see,&#8221; said Valek. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t like
to play.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seated her on the grass and began picking flowers
and tossing them to her. She stopped crying and
began quietly to pick up the blossoms, whispering
something to the golden butter-cups and raising the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
blue-bells to her lips. I grew quiet too, and lay
down beside Valek and the little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is she like that?&#8221; I finally asked, motioning
with my eyes toward Marusia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is she so quiet, you mean?&#8221; asked Valek.
And then in a tone of absolute conviction, he continued:
&#8220;You see, it is the grey stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the child repeated like a feeble echo. &#8220;It
is the grey stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which grey stone?&#8221; I asked, not understanding
what they meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;The grey stone has sucked her life away,&#8221; Valek
explained, gazing at the sky as before. &#8220;Tiburtsi
says so. Tiburtsi knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the child once more echoed softly. &#8220;Tiburtsi
knows everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>I understood nothing of the puzzling words which
Valek had repeated after Tiburtsi, but the argument
that Tiburtsi knew everything had its effect on me.
I raised myself on one elbow and looked at Marusia.
She was sitting in the same position in which Valek
had placed her, and was still picking up the scattered
flowers. The movements of her thin hands
were slow, her eyes were like blue bruises in her
pale face, and her long lashes were downcast. As I
looked at that wee, pathetic figure I realised that in
Tiburtsi&#8217;s words, although I could not understand
them, there lay a bitter truth. Something was surely
sucking away the life of this strange child that wept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
when other children would have laughed. But how
could a grey stone do this thing?</p>

<p>There was a riddle more dreadful to me than all
the ghosts in the old castle. Let the Turks pining
under ground be never so terrible and the old
count never so cruel, they all smacked of the fantastic
horror of ancient legends. But here was something
incredibly dreadful taking place under my very
eyes. Something formless, pitiless, cruel, and heavy
as a stone was hanging over this little being&#8217;s head,
draining the colour from her cheeks, the brightness
from her eyes, and the life out of her limbs. &#8220;It
must be done at night,&#8221; I thought, and something
wrung my heart until it ached.</p>

<p>I, too, subdued my boisterous ways under the influence
of this feeling. Suiting our actions to our
little lady&#8217;s quiet gravity, Valek and I would put
her down somewhere upon the grass and collect flowers
and little bright-hued pebbles for her, or else we
would catch butterflies, or make her sparrow traps
of bricks. Sometimes, stretched beside her on the
grass, we would lie gazing at the sky and, as we
watched the clouds sailing high above the chapel&#8217;s
crumbling roof, we would tell Marusia stories or
talk with one another.</p>

<p>These conversations cemented the friendship between
Valek and me more firmly every day, and it
grew steadily in spite of the sharp contrast that
our characters presented. He opposed a sorrowful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
gravity to my impulsive high spirits and won
my respect by the masterly, independent way in
which he spoke of grown-up people. He also told
me much that was new to me, things of which I had
never thought before. Noticing that he spoke of
Tiburtsi as of a comrade I asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Tiburtsi your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be,&#8221; he answered thoughtfully, as if the
question had never before occurred to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he love you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered much more decidedly this time.
&#8220;He is always doing things for me, and sometimes,
you know, he kisses me and cries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He loves me and cries too!&#8221; Marusia chimed in,
with a look of childish pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father doesn&#8217;t love me,&#8221; I said sadly. &#8220;He
never kisses me. He is a horrid man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; Valek objected. &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand.
Tiburtsi says he isn&#8217;t. He says the Judge is
the best man in the town, and that the town would
have been ruined long ago if it had not been for
your father and the Priest who has just gone into
a monastery, and the Jewish Rabbi. Those three&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have those three done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The town hasn&#8217;t been ruined because they were
there, so Tiburtsi says, because they look after the
poor people. Your father, you know, once sentenced
a count to punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s so. The count was very angry.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>&#8220;There, you see! It&#8217;s no joke to sentence a
count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Valek repeated. &#8220;Because a count isn&#8217;t
an ordinary person. A count does what he pleases
and drives in a coach, and then <i>that</i> count had
money. He would have given money to any other
judge, and the judge would have let him go and
condemned a poor man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s true. I heard the count shouting in
our house: &#8216;I can buy and sell every one of you!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did the Judge say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father said: &#8216;Get out of my sight!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, now, you see! And Tiburtsi says he isn&#8217;t
afraid to drive a rich man away, but when old
Ivanovna came to him with her rheumatism he had
a chair brought for her. He&#8217;s like that! Even
Turkevich has never raised a rumpus under his
windows.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was true; when he was on his denunciatory
expeditions Turkevich always passed by our windows
in silence, and sometimes even took off his cap.</p>

<p>All this set me thinking deeply. Valek was showing
me my father in a light in which I had never
before seen him, and the boy&#8217;s words touched
chords of filial pride in my heart. I was pleased
to hear these praises of my father coming from Tiburtsi
who &#8220;knew everything,&#8221; but there still quivered
in my breast, with a pang of aching love, the bitter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
certainty that this man never could and never
would love me as Tiburtsi loved his children.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p class="caption">AMONG THE &#8220;GREY STONES&#8221;</p>

<p>Several days passed. The &#8220;bad company&#8221; ceased
to appear in town, and I wandered through the streets
in vain, feeling sad and lonely, waiting for them to
return so that I might hasten to the hill.</p>

<p>Only the Professor came down once with his sleepy
walk; neither Tiburtsi nor Turkevich appeared. I
was thoroughly unhappy, for not to see Valek and
Marusia had come to be a great loss to me. But
one day as I was walking down the street with
hanging head Valek suddenly laid his hand upon my
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you come to see us any more?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid to&mdash;I haven&#8217;t seen your people in
town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O&mdash;oh&mdash;and I never thought of telling you! Our
people aren&#8217;t at home; you can come. And I thought
it was something else!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were tired of coming.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>&#8220;No, no! I&#8217;m coming at once; I even have the
apples here with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>At mention of the apples Valek suddenly turned
toward me as if he wanted to say something,
but nothing came, and he only gave me an odd
look.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter, no matter,&#8221; he dismissed the question,
seeing that I was looking expectantly at him.
&#8220;Go along up the hill; I have something to do; I&#8217;ll
catch you up on the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>I walked along, glancing back frequently, expecting
to be overtaken by Valek, but I had climbed the
hill and reached the chapel before he had appeared.
I stopped in doubt as to what I ought to do. Before
me lay the graveyard, desolate and hushed,
without the faintest sign of human habitation. Only
sparrows were twittering in the sunshine, and a
thicket of wild cherry trees, honeysuckle, and lilac
bushes that nestled close up under the southern wall
of the chapel was softly whispering something with
its dark, dense foliage.</p>

<p>I looked about. Where should I go next? Clearly,
the only thing to do was to wait for Valek. So I
began to wander among the graves, idly trying to
decipher the epitaphs on the mossy tombstones. As
I was roaming thus from grave to grave, I suddenly
stumbled upon a large, half-ruined vault. The
roof of this vault had been taken off or else had been
torn away by storms, and was lying close at hand.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
The door was boarded up. Out of curiosity I
propped an old cross against the wall, climbed up,
and peered into the vault. It was empty, but a
window with glass panes had been let into the centre
of the floor, and under these panes there gaped the
black void of a subterranean chamber.</p>

<p>While I was looking into this tomb and marvelling
at the strange situation of the window, Valek came
running, panting and tired, to the top of the hill. He
was carrying a large loaf of Jewish bread in his
arms, something was sticking out from under his
coat, and the perspiration was streaming down his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he cried at sight of me. &#8220;There you are!
If Tiburtsi should find you here, how angry he would
be! But it&#8217;s too late to do anything now. I know
you&#8217;re all right and won&#8217;t tell any one where we
live. Let&#8217;s go in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go in where? Is it far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see. Follow me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed aside the twigs of the honeysuckle and
lilac bushes and disappeared into the thicket beneath
the chapel wall. I followed him, and found myself
on a small trampled patch of earth which had been
entirely concealed from me before by foliage. Between
the stems of the cherry trees I saw a fairly
large opening from which a flight of earthen steps
led downward. Valek started down, bidding me follow
him, and in a few seconds we found ourselves in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
darkness underground. Valek took my hand and
led me through a narrow, damp passage, until, turning
sharply to the right, we emerged into a spacious
crypt.</p>

<p>I stopped at the entrance, amazed at this unexpected
sight. Two beams of light fell sharply from
overhead, painting two luminous bands across the
darkness of the crypt. This light came from a
couple of windows, one of which I had seen in the
floor of the vault, and another, which lay beyond and
which had evidently been constructed in the same
way as the first. The rays of the sun did not fall
directly upon these windows, but were reflected into
them from the walls of the two old vaults. This light
was diffused in the grey air underground, and fell
upon the flag-stone floor, from which it was reflected
once more, filling the crypt with a dusky shimmer.
The walls were also of stone, and massive, thick columns,
rising ponderously from the floor, spread their
stone arches in all directions and at last firmly
clasped the vaulted roof above.</p>

<p>Two figures were sitting in a patch of light on the
floor. The old Professor, with bowed head and
muttering something to himself, was cobbling his
rags together with a needle. He did not even look
up as we entered the crypt, and had it not been for
the slight movement of his hands, his grey figure
might easily have been mistaken for some grotesque
piece of stone carving.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>Under the other window sat Marusia by a little
heap of flowers, sorting them over, as her custom
was. A beam of light fell on her fair curls, bathing
her in radiance from head to foot, but in spite
of this she stood out a strange little misty speck
against the grey stone background, looking as if
she might melt and vanish at any moment. Whenever
a cloud passed over the earth, dimming the
sun&#8217;s brightness, this background seemed to slip
away and disappear, swallowed up in darkness, but
when the sun shone out anew, the cold, cruel stones
stood out once more, clasping each other above the
tiny figure of the child in an indissoluble embrace.
I involuntarily remembered Valek&#8217;s saying about the
&#8220;grey stone&#8221; that was draining Marusia&#8217;s merriment
away, and a feeling of superstitious fear came
stealing into my heart. I seemed to be aware of
an invisible but terrible stony stare directed at her,
rapacious and intent; I felt that the crypt was keenly
eyeing its prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Valek!&#8221; lisped Marusia gaily, as she caught sight
of her brother. When she saw me with him a faint
light shone in her eyes.</p>

<p>I gave her the apples I had brought, and Valek,
breaking the loaf in two, gave her a piece and handed
the rest to the Professor. That unhappy man of
learning accepted the gift indifferently, and began
munching without tearing himself away from his
occupation. I shivered and moved uneasily, stifled,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
as it were, by the oppressive &#8220;stare&#8221; of those grey
stones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come! Come away from here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I insisted,
plucking at Valek&#8217;s sleeve. &#8220;Take her away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Marusia, let&#8217;s go upstairs,&#8221; Valek called
to his sister.</p>

<p>And the three of us climbed up out of the crypt,
but even out of doors I felt a sense of restlessness
and strain. Valek was sadder and more silent than
usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you stay in town to buy that bread?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;To buy it?&#8221; laughed Valek. &#8220;Where would I find
the money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get it then? Did you ask for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s likely! Who would give it to me?
No, brother, I nabbed it from Sarah the Jewess&#8217;
bread-tray at the bazaar. She didn&#8217;t see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said this in a matter-of-fact voice, sprawling
on the grass with his hands under his head. I raised
myself on my elbow and stared at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you stole it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>I threw myself back on the grass and we lay for
a minute in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wicked to steal!&#8221; I burst out, full of the saddest
perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our people were all away. Marusia was crying
because she was hungry.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>&#8220;Yes, I was hungry,&#8221; repeated the child with pitiful
simplicity.</p>

<p>I had not yet discovered what hunger was, but at
the little one&#8217;s last words my breast heaved and I
stared at my friends as if I were seeing them for the
first time. Valek was lying on the grass as before,
pensively watching a soaring sparrow-hawk, but he
now no longer looked impressive. At the sight of
Marusia holding her piece of bread in both hands
my heart absolutely stopped beating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8221;&mdash;I asked with an effort&mdash;&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t
you tell me this before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to tell you, and then I changed my
mind. You have no money of your own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what difference does that make? I should
have brought a loaf from home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, on the sly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes-es&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you would have stolen it too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;it would have been from my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s worse!&#8221; said Valek decidedly. &#8220;I never
rob my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I should have asked for it. He would
have given it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he might have given it to you once&mdash;but
how could he provide for all the beggars in town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you&mdash;beggars?&#8221; I asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we are beggars,&#8221; answered Valek bluntly
and gruffly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>I said nothing, and in a few minutes I rose to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going away already?&#8221; asked Valek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was going because I could not, that day, play
tranquilly with my friends as before. The pure,
childish affection I had felt for them was sullied.
Although the love I bore Valek and Marusia was
not diminished, there was now mingled with it a sharp
current of pity that turned it to a burning heartache.
On reaching home I went to bed early because
I did not know where to lay this new feeling of pain
with which my whole soul was burning. I buried
my head under my pillow and wept bitterly until
kindly sleep at last came with her soft breath to
blow away my grief.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p class="caption">TIBURTSI APPEARS ON THE SCENE</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning! I thought you weren&#8217;t coming
back any more!&#8221; this was Valek&#8217;s greeting to me
when I appeared on the hill next day.</p>

<p>I understood why he had said this.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&mdash;I shall always come here,&#8221; I answered
firmly, to put an end to that question forever.</p>

<p>Valek&#8217;s spirits rose perceptibly at this answer and
we both felt more at ease.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>&#8220;Well, and where are your people?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t they come back yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. The Lord knows what has become of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went gaily to work to manufacture a cunning
sparrow trap for which I had brought the string.
This string we put into Marusia&#8217;s hand, and whenever
a thoughtless sparrow came hopping carelessly
into the snare, Marusia would pull the string, and
the cover would slam down over the bird, which we
would afterwards release.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at noon, the sky had grown overcast.
Dark clouds soon came rolling up, and we could
hear the storm roaring between merry claps of thunder.
I was very unwilling, at first, to go down into
the crypt, but remembering that Valek and Marusia
lived there always I overcame the unpleasant sensation,
and went with them. All was dark and quiet
there, but we could hear the muffled din of the thunder
overhead rumbling exactly as if some one were
driving an enormous wagon over a monstrous bridge.
I soon grew more accustomed to the crypt, and we
stood listening happily to the broad sheets of rain
descending upon the earth, while the roar and crash
of the incessant thunder-claps keyed up our nerves
and woke in us an animation that demanded an
outlet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let&#8217;s play blind-man&#8217;s buff!&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>They tied a bandage over my eyes. Marusia&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
pitiful little laughter rang out as her languid feet
stumbled across the stone floor, while I ran in pursuit,
until I suddenly found myself bending over a
wet form, and at the same moment felt some one
seize my leg. A powerful arm raised me off
the floor and held me upside down in the air. The
bandage fell from my eyes.</p>

<p>Tiburtsi, angry and wet and more terrible than
ever from being seen upside down, was holding me
by the leg and wildly rolling his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this, hey?&#8221; he asked sternly, glaring at
Valek. &#8220;So you are passing the time gaily here!
You have pleasant company, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go!&#8221; I cried, surprised that I was able
to speak at all in such an unusual position, but
Tiburtsi only held my leg the tighter.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Responde!</i> Answer!&#8221; he sternly commanded
Valek, who was standing under these difficult circumstances
with two fingers thrust into his mouth, as
if to proclaim that he had absolutely nothing to
say.</p>

<p>I could see, though, that he was watching my unhappy
person swinging in space like a pendulum
with sympathetic eyes and a great deal of compassion.</p>

<p>Tiburtsi raised me and looked into my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha, this is little master Judge unless my eyes
deceive me! Why does his honour favour us with
a visit?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>&#8220;Let me go!&#8221; I cried stubbornly. &#8220;Let me go
at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>And at this I instinctively made a movement as
if I were stamping my foot on the ground, but
the only result was the quivering of my body in
mid-air.</p>

<p>Tiburtsi roared with laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha, ha! My Lord the Judge is pleased to
be annoyed! But come, you don&#8217;t know me yet.
<i>Ego Tiburtsi sum.</i> And I am going to hold you
over a fire, like this, and roast you like a little
pig.&#8221;</p>

<p>I began to think that this would inevitably be my
fate, especially as Valek&#8217;s despairing face seemed
to foretell the possibility of such a sad ending, but
fortunately Marusia came to my rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be frightened, Vasia! Don&#8217;t be frightened!&#8221;
she admonished me, going right up to Tiburtsi&#8217;s
legs. &#8220;He never roasts little boys over a
fire. That isn&#8217;t true!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tiburtsi turned me right side up with a swift
movement, and set me on my feet; at this I nearly
fell down, for my head was swimming, but he supported
me with his hand and then, sitting down on
a log, stood me between his knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how did you get here?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Have you
been coming here long? You tell me!&#8221; he commanded,
turning to Valek when he saw that I would
not answer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>&#8220;A long time,&#8221; answered the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Six days.&#8221;</p>

<p>This answer seemed to please Tiburtsi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha, six days!&#8221; he said, turning me round so
that I faced him. &#8220;Six days is a long time. And
have you babbled to any one yet where you have
been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not to any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Bene</i>, that is excellent. The chances are that
you will not henceforth babble. I always did think
you were a decent little fellow from meeting you on
the street. You&#8217;re a real little guttersnipe, even if
you are a judge. Have you come here to try us,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke kindly enough, but my feelings were
deeply hurt, therefore I answered crossly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a judge. I&#8217;m Vasia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one doesn&#8217;t interfere with the other, and
Vasia can be a judge too&mdash;not now, but later on.
It&#8217;s an old story. For instance, I am Tiburtsi, he
is Valek; I am a beggar, he is a beggar. In fact,
to speak frankly, I steal and he will steal too. Your
father tries me now; very well then, some day you
will try Valek. There you have it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t try Valek,&#8221; I answered gloomily. &#8220;That
isn&#8217;t true.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>&#8220;He won&#8217;t try Valek,&#8221; Marusia spoke up for me,
confidently dismissing such an atrocious supposition.</p>

<p>The little girl nestled confidingly against the legs
of this monster, and he tenderly stroked her curls
with his sinewy hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that too soon,&#8221; said the strange fellow
pensively, turning to me and speaking as if I were
a grown man. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say that, <i>amice</i>! It&#8217;s an old
story; every man to his own, <i>suum cuique</i>; every one
must go his own way, and who knows, perhaps it&#8217;s
a good thing that your path has crossed ours. It&#8217;s
a good thing for you, <i>amice</i>, because it&#8217;s a good
thing to have a human heart in one&#8217;s breast and
not a cold stone&mdash;do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>I understood nothing, but nevertheless I fixed my
gaze on this queer person&#8217;s face. Tiburtsi&#8217;s eyes
were looking deeply into mine, and there gleamed
dimly in them something that seemed to pierce into
my very soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t understand, because you are
still a child. Therefore let me tell you briefly that
you may some day remember the words of the philosopher
Tiburtsi. If you ever find yourself sitting in
judgment upon that boy there, remember that even
in the days when you were both silly little lads
playing together, you were travelling upon the road
where men walk well-clothed and well-fed, while he
was running along, a ragged sans-culotte with an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
empty belly. And besides, until that happens, remember
one thing well,&#8221; he added, sharply changing
his tone. &#8220;If you whisper one word of what you
have seen here to that Judge of yours, or even to
a bird, as sure as my name is Tiburtsi Drab I&#8217;ll hang
you up by the heels in that fireplace and make roast
ham of you. You understand that, I hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t tell any one&mdash;I&mdash;may I come again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may, I give you my permission&mdash;<i>sum conditionem</i>&mdash;but
you&#8217;re stupid yet and don&#8217;t understand
Latin. I have already told you about that
ham&mdash;now remember!&#8221;</p>

<p>He let me go, and stretched himself wearily on a
bench by the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring me that there,&#8221; he said to Valek, pointing
to a large bag which he had left on the threshold
as he came in. &#8220;And light the fire. We&#8217;re going
to cook dinner to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was now no longer the same man who had
frightened me a short while ago by rolling his eyes, or
the mountebank who was wont to amuse the public
for pennies. He had taken his place as a host at the
head of his family, and, like a man who has returned
from his daily toil, he issued commands to
his household.</p>

<p>He seemed very tired. His clothes were drenched
with rain, his hair was clinging to his brow, and his
whole expression was one of utter weariness. It
was the first time I had seen that look on the face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
of the jolly orator of the caf&eacute;s, and this glimpse
behind the scenes of an actor resting after playing
a difficult and exhausting r&ocirc;le on the stage of life,
filled my heart with a feeling of pain and dread.
It was another of those revelations with which the
old chapel had been so rife for me.</p>

<p>Valek and I went quickly to work. Valek lit a
little torch, and together we entered a dark passage
adjoining the crypt. There, in a corner, lay some
logs of half-decayed wood, bits of crosses, and old
boards. We chose several pieces out of this store
and, heaping them up in the fireplace, kindled a little
fire. Then I had to stand aside while Valek with
knowing hands went to work alone on the cooking.</p>

<p>Half an hour later some kind of a brew was already
stewing in a pot over the fire, and while we
were waiting for it to cook, Valek placed upon a
rough three-legged table a frying pan in which
some pieces of meat were steaming.</p>

<p>Tiburtsi rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it ready?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s splendid.
Sit down with us, boy, you have earned your dinner.
Domine!&#8221;&mdash;he next shouted to the Professor.
&#8220;Put down your needle and come to the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a minute,&#8221; answered the Professor in a low
voice. Such a sensible remark from him surprised
me.</p>

<p>But the spark of consciousness that Tiburtsi&#8217;s
voice had awakened in him did not reappear. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
old man thrust his needle into his rags and indifferently,
with a dull look, took his seat on one of the
logs that served as chairs in the crypt.</p>

<p>Tiburtsi held Marusia on his lap. She and Valek
ate with an appetite that showed what a rare luxury
meat was for them; Marusia even licked her
greasy little fingers. Tiburtsi ate with frequent
pauses, and, evidently obeying an irresistible impulse
to talk, turned his conversation to the Professor.
The poor man of letters grew surprisingly
attentive whenever he did this, and bowed his
head to listen, with a great air of intelligence as if
he understood every word. Sometimes he even signified
his assent by nodding and making soft little
moans.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Domine, how little a man needs,&#8221; Tiburtsi
said. &#8220;Am I not right? There! now our hunger
is appeased, and all that now remains for us to
do is to thank God&mdash;and the Roman Catholic Priest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha, aha!&#8221; agreed the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You agree with me, Domine, but you don&#8217;t know
what the Priest has to do with it. I know you well.
Nevertheless, if it weren&#8217;t for the Priest we shouldn&#8217;t
be eating fried meat and other things now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he give it to you?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;This youngster has an inquiring mind, Domine,&#8221;
Tiburtsi continued. &#8220;Of course his Reverence gave
us this, although we did not ask him for it, and although
not only his left hand knew not what his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
right hand was doing, but neither hand had the
slightest knowledge of the transaction. Eat,
Domine!&#8221;</p>

<p>All I could understand from this strange, confused
discourse was, that the method of obtaining
our dinner had not been quite regular, and I could
not refrain from asking another question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you&mdash;take this yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy is not devoid of shrewdness,&#8221; Tiburtsi
continued. &#8220;It is only a pity that he hasn&#8217;t seen
the Priest. The Priest has a belly like a forty-gallon
cask, and it&#8217;s no doubt very dangerous for
him to indulge in greed. On the other hand all of
us here suffer rather from an excess of leanness than
from corpulence, therefore a certain amount of food
does not come amiss. Am I right, Domine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha, aha!&#8221; pensively moaned the Professor again.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, you see! You have expressed your meaning
extremely successfully this time. I was beginning
to think that this youngster here had more
brains than some men of learning. However, to return
to the Priest, I always think that a good lesson
is worth the price, and in this case we can say that
we bought these provisions from him. If he makes
the doors of his store-house a little stronger in future
we shall be quits. However,&#8221; he cried, suddenly
turning to me, &#8220;you are stupid still and there is
much you don&#8217;t understand. But she, there, will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
understand. Tell me, my Marusia, did I do right
to bring you some meat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; answered the child, her sapphire eyes shining
softly, &#8220;Manya was hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>At twilight that evening I turned homeward with
a reeling brain. Tiburtsi&#8217;s strange sayings had not
for a moment stilled the conviction in my breast that
it was &#8220;wicked to steal.&#8221; On the contrary, the painful
sensation that I had felt before had grown
stronger than ever. They were beggars, thieves,
they had no home! From every one around me I had
long ago heard that contempt was always attached
to such people. I felt all the poignancy of contempt
rising from the bottom of my soul, but I instinctively
shielded my affection from this bitter alloy, and
did not allow the two feelings to mingle. As a
result of these dark workings of my soul, my pity
for Valek and Marusia grew greater and more acute,
but my affection did not diminish. The formula
that &#8220;it was wicked to steal&#8221; remained inviolate in
my mind, but when I saw in imagination my small
friend licking her greasy little fingers I rejoiced in
her joy and in Valek&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Next evening, in one of our dark garden paths,
I unexpectedly met my father. He was pacing up
and down as usual, staring before him with his accustomed
strange, vacant look. When I appeared
beside him he put his hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>&#8220;I&mdash;I have been out walking.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me sharply and seemed to want to
say something, but his eyes soon grew abstracted
again, and, with a motion of his hand, he walked
away down the path. Even in those days I seemed
to understand the meaning of that gesture. It
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, what does it matter? <i>She</i> is not here!&#8221;</p>

<p>I had lied almost for the first time in my life.</p>

<p>I had always been afraid of my father, and I now
feared him more than ever. I was harbouring in
my breast a whole world of vague questions and sensations.
Could he understand me? Could I confess
anything to him without betraying my friends?
I trembled at the thought that in due time he would
hear of my acquaintance with that &#8220;bad company,&#8221;
but, betray Valek and Marusia&mdash;no, that I could
never do! There was a reason for my resolve: if
I broke my word and betrayed them, I should never
be able to raise my eyes to their faces again for
shame.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p class="caption">AUTUMN</p>

<p>Autumn was drawing near. In the fields the
harvest was being reaped; the leaves were turning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
yellow in the woods. With the approach of autumn
Marusia&#8217;s health began to fail.</p>

<p>It was not that she complained of any pain, but
she grew thinner every day; her face grew paler, her
eyes grew larger and darker, and it was with difficulty
that she could raise her drooping eyelids.</p>

<p>I could climb the hill now without caring whether
the &#8220;bad company&#8221; was there or not. I had grown
thoroughly accustomed to them, and felt absolutely
at home in their abode.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a fine youngster, and you&#8217;ll be a great
man some day,&#8221; Tiburtsi predicted.</p>

<p>The younger &#8220;suspicious persons&#8221; made me a bow
and arrow out of elm wood; the tall, red-nosed Grenadier
twirled me in the air like a leaf as he gave me
gymnastic lessons. Only the Professor and Lavrovski
always seemed to remain unconscious of my
presence. The Professor was forever in the midst
of some deep dream, while Lavrovski, when he was
sober, by nature avoided all human intercourse, and
preferred to crouch in a corner by himself.</p>

<p>All these people lived apart from Tiburtsi who,
with his &#8220;family,&#8221; occupied the crypt I have already
spoken of. They inhabited a crypt which was similar
to ours but larger, and which was divided from it
by two narrow halls. Here was less light and more
dampness and gloom. In places along the walls
stood wooden benches and the blocks which served
as chairs. The benches were littered with heaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
of rags, which had converted them into beds. In the
middle of the crypt, under a ray of light, stood a
joiner&#8217;s bench at which Tiburtsi and the others
sometimes worked. The &#8220;bad company&#8221; included
a cobbler and a basket maker, but all, with the exception
of Tiburtsi, were either starvelings or triflers;
men, I noticed, whose hands trembled too much
for them to do any work successfully. The floor of
this crypt was always strewn with chips and shavings
and dirt, and disorder reigned supreme, even though
Tiburtsi scolded the inmates furiously at times, and
made one of them sweep the floor and put the gloomy
abode in order if ever so little. I did not often visit
them because I could not accustom myself to the
foul air, and because, too, the sombre Lavrovski dwelt
there when he was sober. He was generally either
sitting on a bench with his head in his hands, his
long hair streaming, or pacing up and down from
corner to corner with swift strides. His
whole person breathed an atmosphere of such depression
and gloom that my nerves could not endure
it. His fellow-unfortunates, however, had long
since grown accustomed to his eccentric ways.
&#8220;General Turkevich&#8221; would sometimes set him to
work making fair copies of petitions and of quips
and quirks which he himself had written for the
townsfolk, or else he would make him write out the
lampoons which he afterwards nailed to the lamp
posts of the city. Lavrovski would then quietly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
take his seat at a table in Tiburtsi&#8217;s room, and for
hours at a time would sit forming, one after another,
the beautiful, even letters of his exquisite
handwriting. Twice I chanced to see him carried
down stupefied with drink from above ground into
the crypt. The unhappy man&#8217;s head was dangling
and banging from side to side, his legs were trundling
helplessly after him and bumping down the stone
steps, his face wore a look of misery, and tears were
trickling down his cheeks. Marusia and I, clinging
tightly to one another, watched these scenes from
a distant corner, but Valek mixed quite nonchalantly
with the men, supporting now a hand, now a foot,
now the head of the helpless Lavrovski.</p>

<p>Everything about these people that had amused
and interested me like a Punch and Judy show when
I saw it in the streets was revealed to me here, behind
the scenes, in all its ugly nakedness, and the
sight of it weighed heavily upon my childish spirits.</p>

<p>Here Tiburtsi held undisputed sway. It was he
who had discovered the crypts, he who had taken
possession of them, and all his band obeyed him implicitly.
That is probably the reason why I do not
remember one single occasion on which any one of
those creatures, who had certainly lost all the semblance
of human beings, ever came to me with an evil
suggestion.</p>

<p>Having gained in knowledge from a prosaic experience
of life, I know now that there must have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
been a certain amount of depravity, petty vice, and
rottenness among them, but to-day, when those people
and scenes rise in my memory wrapped in the
mists of the past, I see before me only tragedy, poverty,
and the profoundest sadness.</p>

<p>Oh, Childhood and Youth, what great fountainheads
of idealism you are!</p>

<p>And now Autumn began to come into its own.
The sky was more frequently overcast, the surrounding
country sank into a misty crepuscule, torrents
of rain swept noisily across the earth, and their
thunder resounded monotonously and mournfully in
the crypt.</p>

<p>I found it very hard to steal away from home in
this weather, for my one desire was to get away
unnoticed. When I came back drenched to the skin,
I would hang up my clothes before the fire myself,
and slip quietly into bed, there to endure philosophically
the torrents of scolding that would invariably
flow from the lips of the servants and my
nurse.</p>

<p>Every time I visited my friends I noticed that
Marusia&#8217;s health was failing more and more. She
never went out into the fresh air now, and the grey
stone&mdash;that unseen, silent monster of the crypt&mdash;did
its dreadful work without interruption, sucking
the life out of her little body. The child spent
most of her time in bed, and Valek and I exhausted
every means in our power to amuse and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
interest her and to awaken the soft peals of her
frail laughter.</p>

<p>Now that I had really become one of the &#8220;bad
company&#8221; the child&#8217;s sad smile had grown almost
as dear to me as my sister&#8217;s, but with Marusia I
was not constantly reminded of my wickedness; here
was no scolding nurse; on the contrary, I knew
that each time I came my arrival would call the
colour into Marusia&#8217;s cheeks. Valek embraced me
like a brother, and even Tiburtsi would sometimes
watch us three with a strange expression on his face
and something very like tears glistening in his eyes.</p>

<p>Then one day the sky grew clear again. The last
clouds blew away, and the sun shone out upon the
earth for the last time before winter&#8217;s coming. We
carried Marusia up into the sunlight, and there she
seemed to revive. She gazed about her with wide
eyes, and the colour came into her cheeks. It seemed
as if the wind that was blowing over her with its cool,
fresh breath were returning to her part of the life-blood
stolen by the grey stones of the crypt. But
alas! this did not last long.</p>

<p>And in the meanwhile clouds were beginning to
gather over my head as well.</p>

<p>One morning as I was running down the garden
path as usual I caught sight of my father and old
Yanush of the castle. The old man was cringing
and bowing and saying something to my father, and
the latter was standing before him, gloomy and stern,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
with a frown of impatient anger between his eyes. At
last my father stretched out his hand as if to push
Yanush aside, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away! You are nothing but an old gossip!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man blinked and, holding his hat in his
hand, ran forward again and stood in my father&#8217;s
path. My father&#8217;s eyes flashed with anger. Yanush
was speaking in a low voice, and I could not hear
what he was saying, but my father&#8217;s broken sentences
fell upon my ears with the utmost distinctness,
like the blows of a whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe a word of it&mdash;What do you want
to persecute those people for?&mdash;I won&#8217;t listen to
verbal accusations, and a written one you would
be obliged to prove&mdash;Silence! that is my business&mdash;I
won&#8217;t listen to you, I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He finally pushed Yanush away so firmly that the
latter did not dare to intrude upon him any longer.
My father turned aside into another path, and I
ran out through the gate.</p>

<p>I very much disliked this old owl of the castle, and
I trembled now with a premonition of evil. I realised
that the conversation I had overheard related
to my friends and perhaps, also, to me.</p>

<p>When I told Tiburtsi what had happened he made
a dreadful face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew, young one, what bad news that is! Oh,
that accursed old fox!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>&#8220;My father drove him away,&#8221; I answered to console
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father, young man, is the best judge there
has been since the days of Solomon, but do you know
what <i>curriculum vit&aelig;</i> means? Of course you don&#8217;t.
But you know what the Record of Service is, don&#8217;t
you? Well, <i>curriculum vit&aelig;</i> is the Record of Service
of a man who is not employed in the County Court,
and if that old screech-owl has been able to ferret
out anything and can show your father my record
why&mdash;well, I swear to the Queen of Heaven I wouldn&#8217;t
care to fall into the Judge&#8217;s clutches!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not a cruel man, is he?&#8221; I asked, remembering
what Valek had told me.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, my boy, God forbid that you should think
that of your father! Your father has a good heart.
Perhaps he already knows everything that Yanush
has been able to tell him, and still holds his tongue.
He doesn&#8217;t think it is necessary to pursue a toothless
old lion into his last lair. But how can I explain it
to you, my boy? Your father works for a gentleman
whose name is Law. He has eyes and a heart
only as long as Law is nicely tucked up in bed, but
when that gentleman gets up and comes to your
father and says: &#8216;Come on, Judge, sha&#8217;n&#8217;t we get on
the trail of Tiburtsi Drab or whatever his name is?&#8217;
from that moment the Judge must lock up his heart,
and his claws will become so sharp that the earth
will turn upside down before Tiburtsi will escape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
out of his clutches. Do you understand, my boy?
And that&#8217;s why I, why we all, respect your father as
we do, because he is a faithful servant of his master,
and such men are rare. If all Law&#8217;s servants were
like him, Law could sleep quietly in his bed and
never wake up at all. My whole trouble is that I
had a quarrel with Law a long time ago&mdash;ah yes, my
boy, a very violent quarrel!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he said this Tiburtsi got up, took Marusia&#8217;s
hand, and, leading her into a distant corner, began
kissing her and pressing his rough head to her tiny
breast. I stood motionless where I was under the
spell of the impression created by the strange words
of this strange man. In spite of the fantastic and
unintelligible twists and turns of his speech I understood
perfectly the substance of what Tiburtsi had
said, and my father&#8217;s image loomed more imposing
than ever in my imagination, invested with a halo
of stern but lovable strength amounting almost to
grandeur. But at the same time another and a bitterer
feeling which I bore in my breast had increased
in intensity. &#8220;That&#8217;s what he&#8217;s like!&#8221; I thought.
&#8220;And he doesn&#8217;t love me!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p class="caption">THE DOLL</p>

<p>The bright days soon passed, and Marusia began
to grow worse again. She now gazed indifferently
with her large, fixed, darkening eyes at all our cunning
devices for her amusement, and it was long
since we had heard her laughter. I began to bring
my playthings to the crypt, but they only diverted
her for a short time. I then decided to turn for
help to my sister Sonia.</p>

<p>Sonia had a large doll with magnificent long hair
and cheeks painted a brilliant red, a present from
our mother. I had the greatest faith in the powers
of this doll, and therefore, calling my sister into a
distant part of the garden one day, I asked her to
lend it to me. I begged so earnestly and described
the little suffering girl who had no toys of her own
so vividly that Sonia, who at first had only clasped
the doll more tightly to her breast, handed it to
me and promised to play with her other toys for
two or three days and to forget the doll entirely.</p>

<p>The effect produced on Marusia by this gaily
dressed young lady with the china face exceeded all
my wildest hopes. The child, who had been fading
like a flower in Autumn, suddenly seemed to revive
again. How tightly she hugged me! How merrily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
she laughed as she chattered to her new acquaintance!
The doll almost worked a miracle. Marusia,
who had not left her bed for many days, began
to toddle about, pulling her fair-haired daughter
after her, and even ran a few steps, dragging
her weak little feet across the floor as she had done
in former days.</p>

<p>At the same time the doll gave me many an anxious
moment. In the first place, on my way to the
hill with my prize under my coat, I had met Yanush
on the road, and the old man had followed me for a
long time with his eyes, and shaken his head. Then,
two days later, our old nurse had noticed the disappearance
of the doll, and had begun poking her
nose into every corner in search of it. Sonia tried
to appease her, but the child&#8217;s artless assurances
that she didn&#8217;t want the doll, that the doll had gone
out for a walk and would soon come back, only served
to create doubts in the minds of the servants, and
to awaken their suspicions that this might not simply
be a question of loss. My father knew nothing
as yet, and though Yanush, who came to him again
one day, was sent away even more angrily than before,
my father stopped me that morning on the
way to the garden gate and ordered me not to leave
home. The same thing happened on the following
day, and only on the fourth did I get up early and
slip away over the fence while my father was still
asleep.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>Things were still going badly on the hill. Marusia
was in bed again and was worse. Her face was
strangely flushed, her fair curls were lying disheveled
on her pillow, and she recognised no one.
Beside her lay the disastrous doll with its pink cheeks
and its stupid, staring eyes.</p>

<p>I told Valek of the danger I was running, and we
both decided that undoubtedly I ought to take the
doll home, especially as Marusia would not notice its
absence. But we were mistaken! No sooner did I
take the doll out of the arms of the unconscious child
than she opened her eyes, stared vaguely about as if
she did not see me and did not know what was happening
to her, and then suddenly began to cry very,
very softly, but oh, so piteously, while an expression
of such deep sorrow swept across her features
under the veil of her delirium that, panic-stricken, I
immediately laid the doll back in its former place.
The child smiled, drew the doll to her breast, and
grew calm again. I realised that I had tried to deprive
my little friend of the first and last pleasure
of her short life.</p>

<p>Valek looked shyly at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do now?&#8221; he asked sadly.</p>

<p>Tiburtsi, who was sitting on a bench with his head
sunk dejectedly on his breast, also looked at me,
with a question in his eyes. I therefore tried to look
as careless as possible, and said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>&#8220;Never mind; nurse has probably forgotten all
about it by now.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the old woman had not forgotten. When I
reached home that day I again found Yanush at the
garden gate. Sonia&#8217;s eyes were red with weeping
and our nurse threw me an angry, icy glance and
muttered something between her toothless gums.</p>

<p>My father asked me where I had been, and having
listened attentively to my usual answer, confined
himself to telling me not to leave the house without
his permission under any circumstances whatsoever.
This command was categorical and absolutely
peremptory. I dared not disobey it, and at the same
time I could not make up my mind to ask my father
for leave to go to my friends.</p>

<p>Four weary days passed. I spent my time roaming
dejectedly about the garden, gazing longingly in
the direction of the hill, and waiting, too, for the
storm which I felt was gathering over my head. I
had no idea what the future might bring, but my
heart was as heavy as lead. No one had ever punished
me in my life; my father had never so much
as laid a finger on me, and I had never heard a harsh
word from his lips, but I was suffering now from an
oppressive sense of coming misfortune.</p>

<p>At last my father summoned me to his study. I
opened the door and stopped timidly on the threshold.
The melancholy autumn sun was shining in
through the windows. My father was sitting in an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
arm chair before a portrait of my mother, and did
not turn to look at me as I came in. I could hear
the anxious beating of my own heart.</p>

<p>At last my father turned round; I raised my eyes
and instantly dropped them again. My father&#8217;s face
looked terrible to me. Half a minute passed, and I
could feel his stern, fixed, withering gaze riveted
upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you take your sister&#8217;s doll?&#8221;</p>

<p>The words fell upon my ears so suddenly and
sharply that I quivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you know that that doll was a present
from your mother, and that you ought to have preserved
it as something sacred? Did you steal it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered, raising my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you say no?&#8221; my father suddenly
shouted. &#8220;You stole it and took it away. Whom
did you take it to? Speak!&#8221;</p>

<p>He strode swiftly toward me, and laid a heavy
hand upon my shoulder. I raised my head with an
effort, and looked up. My father&#8217;s face was pale.
The frown of pain which had lain between his brows
since my mother&#8217;s death was still there, but now his
eyes were flashing with sombre wrath. I shrank
away. I seemed to see madness&mdash;or was it hatred?&mdash;glaring
at me out of those eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what did you do? Answer!&#8221; And the hand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
which was holding my shoulder gripped it more
tightly than before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I won&#8217;t tell you,&#8221; I answered in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you will tell me!&#8221; my father rapped out,
and there was a threat in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t tell you,&#8221; I whispered lower still.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will, you will!&#8221;</p>

<p>He repeated these words in a muffled voice as if
they had burst from him with a painful effort. I felt
his hand trembling, and even seemed to hear the rage
boiling in his breast. My head sank lower and
lower, and tears began to drip slowly out of my eyes
upon the floor, but I still kept repeating almost
inaudibly:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t tell; I&#8217;ll never, never tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was my father&#8217;s son speaking in me. He could
never have succeeded in extorting an answer from
me, no, not by the fiercest tortures. There welled up
in my breast in response to his threats the almost unconscious
feeling of injury that comes to an ill-used
child, and a sort of burning love for those
whose betrayal my father was demanding.</p>

<p>My father drew a deep breath. I shrank away
still farther, and the bitter tears scalded my cheeks.
I waited.</p>

<p>It would be hard for me to describe my sensations
at that moment. I knew that his breast was
seething with rage, and that at any moment my body
might be struggling helplessly in his strong, delirious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
arms. What would he do to me? Would he hurl me
from him? Would he crush me? But I did not seem
to dread that now. I even loved the man in that
moment of fear, but, at the same time, I felt instinctively
that he was about to shatter this love
with one mad effort, and that for ever and ever
after I should carry the same little flame of hatred
in my heart which I had seen gleaming in his eyes.</p>

<p>I had lost all sense of fear. Instead, there had
begun to throb in my heart a feeling exasperating,
bold, challenging; I seemed to be waiting, and longing
for the catastrophe to come at last.</p>

<p>It would be better so&mdash;yes&mdash;better&mdash;better&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Once more my father sighed heavily. I was no
longer looking at him. I only heard his sighs, long,
deep, and convulsive, and I know not to this day
whether he himself overcame the frenzy that possessed
him or whether it failed to find an outlet owing
to an unexpected occurrence. I only know that at
that critical moment Tiburtsi suddenly shouted under
the open window in his harsh voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, there, my poor little friend!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tiburtsi is here!&#8221; flashed through my mind, but
his coming made no other impression on me. I was
all beside myself with suspense, and did not even
heed the trembling of my father&#8217;s hand upon my
shoulder, or realise that Tiburtsi&#8217;s appearance or
any other external circumstance could come between
my father and myself, or could avert that which I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
believed to be inevitable, and which I was awaiting
with such a flood of passionate anger.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tiburtsi had quickly opened the door
of the room, and now stood on the threshold embracing
us both with his piercing, lynx-like glance. I can
remember to this day the smallest details of the scene.
For a moment a flash of cold, malevolent mockery
gleamed in the greenish eyes and passed over the
wide, uncouth face of this gutter orator, but it was
only a flash. Then he shook his head, and there was
more of sorrow than of his accustomed irony in his
voice as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho, I see that my young friend is in an awkward
situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father received him with a gloomy, threatening
look, but Tiburtsi endured it calmly. He had
grown serious now, and his mockery had ceased.
There was a striking look of sadness in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Lord Judge,&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;You are a
just man; let the child go! The boy has been &#8216;in
bad company,&#8217; but God knows he has done no bad
deeds, and if his little heart is drawn toward my
unfortunate people, I swear to the Queen of Heaven
that you may hang me if you wish, but I will not
allow the boy to suffer for that. Here is your doll,
my lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>He untied a little bundle, and took out the doll.</p>

<p>The hands that had been gripping my shoulder
relaxed. My father looked surprised.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; he asked at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the boy go!&#8221; Tiburtsi repeated, stroking my
bowed head lovingly with his broad palm. &#8220;You will
get nothing out of him with your threats, and besides,
I will gladly tell you everything you want to
know. Come, Your Honour, let us go into another
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father consented, with his eyes fixed in surprise
on Tiburtsi&#8217;s face. They went out together,
and I stayed rooted to the spot, overwhelmed with
the emotions with which my heart was bursting. At
that moment I was unconscious of what was going
on around me, and if, in calling to mind the details
of this scene, I remember that sparrows were twittering
outside the window and that the rhythmic splash
of the water-wheel came to me from the river, why
that is only the mechanical action of my memory.
Nothing external existed for me then; there existed
only a little boy in whose breast two separate emotions
were seething: anger and love; seething so
fiercely that my heart was troubled as a glass of
water is dimmed when two different liquids are poured
into it at the same time. Such a little boy existed,
and that boy was I; I was even sorry, in a way, for
myself. There existed also two voices, that came to
me from the next room in a confused but animated
conversation.</p>

<p>I was still standing on the same spot when the
study door opened, and both talkers came into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
room. Once more I felt a hand on my head, and
trembled.</p>

<p>It was my father&#8217;s, and he was tenderly stroking
my hair.</p>

<p>Tiburtsi took my hands, and set me upon his knees
right in my father&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and see us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Your father will
let you come and say good-bye to my little girl. She&mdash;she
is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tiburtsi&#8217;s voice trembled, and he winked his eyes
queerly, but he at once rose quickly to his feet, set
me down on the floor, pulled himself together, and
left the room.</p>

<p>I raised my eyes inquiringly to my father&#8217;s face.
Another man was standing before me now, and there
was something lovable about him which I had sought
in vain before. He was looking at me with his usual
pensive gaze, but there was a shade of surprise in
his eyes, and what might have been a question. The
storm which had just passed over our heads seemed
to have dispelled the heavy mist that had lain on
my father&#8217;s soul and frozen the gentle, kind expression
on his face. He now seemed to recognise in me
the familiar features of his own son.</p>

<p>I took his hand trustfully, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t steal it. Sonia lent it to me herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered thoughtfully. &#8220;I know; I
am guilty before you, boy, but you will try to forget
it sometime, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>I seized his hand and kissed it. I knew that he
would never again look at me with the dreadful
eyes which I had seen only a few moments before,
and my long pent-up love burst forth in a torrent.
I did not fear him now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you let me go to the hill?&#8221; I suddenly asked,
remembering Tiburtsi&#8217;s invitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es&mdash;go, boy, and say good-bye,&#8221; he answered
tenderly, but with still the same shade of hesitation
in his voice. &#8220;No, wait a minute; wait a minute,
boy, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went into his bed-room and came back in a
minute with a few bills which he thrust into my
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give these to Tiburtsi. Tell him that I beg him&mdash;do
you understand?&mdash;that I beg him to accept this
money&mdash;from you. Do you understand? And say,
too,&#8221; added my father, &#8220;say that if he knows any
one called Feodorovich he had better tell that Feodorovich
to leave this town. And now run along
boy, quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Panting and incoherent, I overtook Tiburtsi on
the hill and gave him my father&#8217;s message.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father begs you to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I said, and pressed
the money which I had received into his hand.</p>

<p>I did not look at his face. He took the money,
and gloomily listened to my message concerning
Feodorovich.</p>

<p>In the crypt, on a bench in a dark corner, I found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Marusia lying. The word death has little meaning
for a child, but bitter tears choked me at the sight
of her lifeless body. My little friend was lying there
looking very serious and sad, and her tiny face was
pitifully drawn. Her closed eyes were a little sunken
and the blue circles around them were darker than
before. Her little mouth was slightly open, and
wore an expression of childish grief. This little
grimace was Marusia&#8217;s answer to our tears.</p>

<p>The Professor was standing at her bedside, indifferently
shaking his head. The Grenadier was
hammering in a corner, making a coffin out of some
old boards torn from the chapel roof. Lavrovski,
sober and with a look of perfect understanding,
was strewing Marusia&#8217;s body with autumn flowers
which he himself had gathered. Valek was lying
asleep in a corner, shuddering all over in his dreams,
and crying out restlessly from time to time.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p class="caption">CONCLUSION</p>

<p>Soon after this the members of the &#8220;bad company&#8221;
dispersed to the four corners of the earth. There remained
behind only the Professor, who until his death
continued to haunt the streets of the town, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
Turkevich, to whom my father would give a little
writing to do from time to time. For my part, I lost
not a little blood in combats with the Jewish boys
who tormented the Professor by reminding him of
sharp and pointed instruments.</p>

<p>The Grenadier and the other suspicious characters
went elsewhere to seek their fortunes. Tiburtsi and
Valek suddenly and completely vanished, and no one
could say whither they had gone, as no one knew
whence they had come.</p>

<p>The old chapel has suffered much since then from
the onslaughts of Time. First the roof fell in, breaking
down the ceiling of the crypt. Then landslides
began to form around the building, and the place
grew more dismal than ever. The owls now hoot more
loudly than before among its ruins, and the will-o&#8217;-the-wisps
on the graves still glow with a malign blue
fire on dark autumn nights.</p>

<p>One grave only, surrounded by a little fence, grows
green with fresh grass every spring, and lies bedecked
with brilliant flowers.</p>

<p>Sonia and I used often to visit this little grave, and
sometimes our father would go with us. We liked to
sit there in the shade of the whispering birch trees,
with the town below us shimmering placidly in the
sunlight. Here my sister and I read and dreamed
together, sharing our first young thoughts and our
first premonitions of upright, winged youth.</p>

<p>And when at last the time came for us to leave the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
quiet city of our birth, it was here, over this little
grave, in the Springtime of life and hope, that we
made our last compacts with one another on the last
day that we spent at home.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Listen</span> to me, man; go out of your khata on a
clear night, or better still walk to the top of some
little hill, and look well at the sky and the earth.
Watch the bright moon climbing the heavens, and
the stars winking and twinkling, and the light clouds
of mist rising from the earth and wandering off
somewhere one behind the other like belated travellers
on a night journey. The woods will lie as if bewitched,
listening to the spells that rise from them
after the midnight hour, and the sleepy river will
flow murmuring by you, whispering to the sycamores<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
on its banks. Then tell me after that if anything,
if any miracle, is not possible in this khata of God&#8217;s
which we call the wide world.</p>

<p>Everything is possible. Take, for instance, an
adventure that happened to a friend of mine, the
miller from Novokamensk. If no one has told you
the story already, I will tell it to you now, only
please don&#8217;t make me swear that every word is true.
I won&#8217;t swear to a thing, for though I got it from
the miller himself, I don&#8217;t know to this day whether
it really happened to him or not.</p>

<p>But whether it&#8217;s true or not, I shall tell it to
you as I heard it.</p>

<p>One evening the miller was returning from vespers
in Novokamensk, which was about three versts, not
more, from his mill. For some reason the miller
was a little out of temper, though he himself could
not have said why. Everything had gone well in the
church, and our miller, who could shout with the
best, had read the prayers so loudly and so fast
that the good people had been astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;How he does bawl, that son of a gun!&#8221; they had
exclaimed with the deepest respect. &#8220;You can&#8217;t understand
one word he says. He&#8217;s a regular wheel,
he is; he turns and spins and you know he has spokes
in him, but you can&#8217;t see a single one, no matter
how closely you look. His reading sounds like an
iron wheel rumbling over a stony road; you can&#8217;t
catch a word of it to save your life.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>The miller heard what the people were saying
among themselves, and it made him glad. <i>He</i> knew
how to work for the glory of God, he did! He
swung his tongue as a lusty lad swings a flail on a
threshing floor, till he was parched to the bottom of
his throat and his eyes were popping out of his
head.</p>

<p>The priest took him home with him after church,
gave him tea, and set a full bottle of herb brandy
before him, and this was afterwards taken away
empty. The moon was floating high above the fields,
and was staring down into the swift little Stony
River when the miller left the priest&#8217;s house and
started home to his mill.</p>

<p>Some of the villagers were already asleep; some
were sitting in their khatas eating their suppers by
the light of a tallow-dip, and some had been tempted
out into the street by the warm, clear autumn
night. The old people were sitting at the doors of
their khatas, but the lasses and lads had gone out
under the hedges where the heavy shade of the cherry
trees hid them from view, and only their low voices
could be heard in various places, with an occasional
peal of suppressed laughter, and now and then the
incautious kiss of a young couple. Yes, many things
can happen in the dense shade of a cherry tree on
such a clear, warm night!</p>

<p>But though the miller could not see the villagers,
they could see him very well because he was walking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
down the middle of the street in the full light of the
moon. And so they occasionally called out to him as
he passed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, Mr. Miller! Aren&#8217;t you coming
from the priest&#8217;s? Is it at his house you have been
such a long time?&#8221;</p>

<p>Every one knew that he could not have been anywhere
else, but the miller liked the question, and,
slackening his pace, he would answer a little proudly
each time:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I&#8217;ve made him a little visit!&#8221; and then
he would walk on more puffed-up than ever.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some of the people sat as
silent as mice under the eaves of their houses, and
only hoped he would go by quickly and not see where
they were hidden. But the miller was not the man
to pass or forget people who owed him for flour or
for grinding, or who simply had borrowed money
from him. No use for them to sit out of sight in the
dark, as silent as if they had taken a mouthful of
water! The miller would stop in front of them every
time and say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening! Are you there? You can hold
your tongues or not as you like, but get ready to
pay me your debts, because your time will be up early
to-morrow morning. And I won&#8217;t wait for the
money, I promise you!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he would walk on down the street with his
shadow running beside him, so black, so very black,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
that the miller, who was a bookman and always ready
to use his brain if need be, said to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness, how black my shadow is! It really is
strange. When a man&#8217;s overcoat is whiter than
flour why should his shadow be blacker than soot?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point in his reflections he reached the inn
kept by Yankel the Jew, which stood on a little hill
not far from the village. The Sabbath had been
over since sunset, but the inn-keeper was not at home;
only Kharko was there, the Jew&#8217;s servant, who took
his place on Sabbaths and feast-days. Kharko lit his
master&#8217;s candles for him and collected his debts on
each Hebrew holiday, for the Jews, as every one
knows, strictly observe the rules of their faith. Do
you think a Jew would light a candle or touch money
on a holiday? Not he! It would be a sin. Kharko
the servant did all that for the inn-keeper, and he, his
wife, and his children, only followed him sharply
with their eyes to see that no stray five or ten copeck
pieces wandered into his pocket by accident instead
of into the till.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re cunning people!&#8221; thought the miller to
himself. &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re very cunning! They know
how to please their God and catch every penny at the
same time. Yes, they&#8217;re clever people, far cleverer
than we are, there&#8217;s no use denying it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused on the little patch of earth at the inn
door trampled hard by the numberless human feet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
that jostled each other there every week day and
shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yankel! Hey, Yankel! Are you at home or
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t at home, can&#8217;t you see that?&#8221; answered
the servant from behind the counter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where should he be? In the city of course,&#8221; answered
the servant. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know what to-day
is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, so that&#8217;s the explanation!&#8221; thought the miller.</p>

<p>And I must tell you that even though Kharko was
a common servant and the servant of a Jew at that,
he had been a soldier, and could write, and was a very
proud person. He liked to turn up his nose and give
himself airs, especially before the miller. He could
read in church no worse than the miller himself, except
that he had a cracked voice and talked through
his nose. In reading the prayers he always managed
to keep up with Philip the miller, but in reading
the Acts he was left far behind. But he never
yielded an inch. If the miller said one thing, he always
said another. If the miller said &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221;
the servant would answer &#8220;I do.&#8221; A disagreeable
fellow he was! So now he was delighted because he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
had said something that had made the miller scratch
his head under his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you don&#8217;t know even yet what day this
is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I keep track of every Jewish holiday?
Am I a servant of Jews?&#8221; retorted the miller angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every holiday, indeed! That&#8217;s just it; this isn&#8217;t
like every holiday. They only have one like this
every year. And let me tell you something: no other
people in the whole world have a holiday like this
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard about Khapun, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221;</p>

<p>The miller only whistled. Of course, he might have
guessed it! And he peeped in through the window of
the Jewish khata. The floor was strewn with hay
and straw; in two and three branched candlesticks
slender tallow candles were burning; he could hear
a humming that seemed to come from several huge,
lusty bees. It was Yankel&#8217;s young second Wife and
a few Jewish children mumbling and humming their
unintelligible prayers with closed eyes. There was,
however, something remarkable about these prayers;
it seemed as if each one of these Jews were possessed
by some alien creature, sitting there in him weeping
and lamenting, remembering something and praying
for something. But to whom were they praying, and
for what were they asking? No one could have said.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
Only whatever it was, it seemed to have no connection
either with the inn or with money.</p>

<p>The miller was filled with pity and sadness and
dread as he listened to the prayers of the Jews. He
glanced at the servant, who could also hear the humming
through the door of the inn, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re praying! And so you say Yankel has
gone to the city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did he want to do that for? Supposing
Khapun should happen to get him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why he went,&#8221; answered the servant.
&#8220;If it had been me, though I&#8217;ve fought with
every heathen tribe under the sun and got a medal
for it, no silver roubles on earth could have tempted
me away from here. I should have stayed in my
khata; Khapun would hardly snatch him out of his
hut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why not? If he wanted to catch a man he&#8217;d
get him in his khata as well as anywhere else, I
suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think he would, do you? If you wanted to
buy a hat or a pair of gloves, where would you go for
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where should I go but to a store?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why would you go to a store?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a question! Because there are plenty of
hats there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. And if you looked into the synagogue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
now you would see Jews a-plenty in there. They are
jostling one another, and weeping and screaming so
that the whole city from one end to another can hear
their lamentations. Where the gnats are there the
birds go. Khapun would be a fool if he trotted about
hunting and rummaging through all the woods and
villages. He has only one day in the year, and do
you think he would waste it like that? Some villages
have Jews in them, and some haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there aren&#8217;t many that haven&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know there aren&#8217;t many that haven&#8217;t, but there
are some. And then, he can pick and choose so much
better out of a crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both men were silent. The miller was thinking
that the servant had caught him again with his
clever tongue, and he was feeling uncomfortable for
the second time. The humming and weeping and
lamenting of the Jews still came to them through
the windows of the hut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they are praying for the old man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they are. Anything is possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it really ever happen?&#8221; asked the miller,
wishing to tease the servant, and at the same time
feeling a twinge of human pity for the Jew. &#8220;Perhaps
it&#8217;s only gossip. You know how people will
gabble silly nonsense, and how every one believes
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>These words displeased Kharko.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, people do gabble nonsense; like you, for instance!&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
he answered. &#8220;Do you think I invented the
story myself, or my father or my father-in-law, when
every Christian knows it is true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, but have you seen it happen yourself?&#8221;
asked the miller irritably, stung by the servant&#8217;s
scornful words.</p>

<p>Now you must know that when the miller was in
a passion he sometimes said that he didn&#8217;t believe
in the Devil himself, and wouldn&#8217;t, until he saw him
sitting in the palm of his hand. And he was flying
into a passion now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen it happen yourself?&#8221; he repeated.
&#8220;If you haven&#8217;t, don&#8217;t say it&#8217;s true, do you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the servant hung his head, and even went so
far as to cough. Though he had been a soldier and
was a lively fellow, he could sing very small at times.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t seen it myself, I won&#8217;t tell you a
lie. And you, Mr. Miller, have you ever seen the city
of Kiev?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t: I won&#8217;t tell you a lie, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Kiev is there just the same!&#8221;</p>

<p>When he heard it put as clearly as that, the miller&#8217;s
eyes nearly popped out of his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever is true, is true,&#8221; he assented. &#8220;Yes,
Kiev is there, though I haven&#8217;t seen it. One certainly
ought to believe what honest folks say. You see, I
should like to&mdash;I want to ask you who told you the
story?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>&#8220;Who told it to me? Bah! Who told you about
Kiev?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut, what a tongue you have! It&#8217;s sharper
than a razor; may it shrivel in your head!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason why my tongue should shrivel
in my head. You&#8217;d better believe what people say
when every one says it. If every one says it, it must
be true. If it weren&#8217;t true, every one wouldn&#8217;t say it;
only magpies like you would say it, so there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut, tut! For Heaven&#8217;s sake stop a minute!
You rattle out your words like a pestle in a
mortar. I see I was on the wrong track, but I only
wanted to know how the story began.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It began because it happens every year. Whatever
happens people will talk about; what doesn&#8217;t
happen isn&#8217;t worth talking about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a fellow you are! Wait a minute, let me
catch your prattle by the tail; you whirl like a wild
mare in a bog. Only just tell me what really takes
place, that&#8217;s all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh hey, so you don&#8217;t know, I see, what takes
place on the Day of Atonement?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to know, and that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t ask. I
used to hear people chattering like you about
Khapun, Khapun, but what the sense of it was I
never could make out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you ought to have said so at once, and I
should have told you long ago. I don&#8217;t like proud
people who, when they want a drink of gorelka,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
say they&#8217;d drink water if it didn&#8217;t taste so bad. If
you want to know what happens I&#8217;ll tell you, because
I&#8217;ve been about the world and am not a stay-at-home
like you. I have lived in the city for more
than a year, and this is the first time I have ever
worked for a Jew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And isn&#8217;t it a sin to work for a Jew?&#8221; asked the
miller.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be for any one else; a soldier can do
anything. We get a paper given to us that says so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can a piece of paper really&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the soldier began telling the miller very
affably all about Khapun and how he carries off one
Jew a year on this day.</p>

<p>And if you don&#8217;t know it, I might as well tell you
that Khapun is a regular Hebrew devil. He is just
like ours in every way, black, with horns just like
him, and he has wings like a huge bat; the only difference
is that he wears ringlets and a skull cap, and
only has power over Jews. If a Christian meets
him at midnight in the desert, or even on the shore of
a pond, he runs away like a scared dog. But he can
do what he likes with the Jews, so he catches one
every year and carries him away.</p>

<p>And Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, is the
day fixed for him to make his choice. Long before
that day comes the Jews weep and tear their clothes,
and even put ashes out of their stoves on their heads
for some reason or other. On the evening of the day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
they bathe in the rivers and ponds, and as soon as
the sun goes down the poor wretches all go to their
churches, and you never heard in your life such
screams as come from there then! They all bawl at
the top of their lungs, keeping their eyes shut tight
with terror all the time. Then, as soon as the sky
grows dark and the evening star comes out, Khapun
comes flying from where he lives, and hovers over the
church. He beats on the windows with his wings, and
looks in to choose his prey. But when midnight
comes, that&#8217;s when the Jews begin to get really
frightened. They light all the candles to give themselves
courage, fall down on the floor, and begin to
scream as if some one were cutting their throats.
And while they are lying there squirming Khapun
flies into the room in the shape of a great
crow, and they all feel the cold wind of his wings
blowing across their hearts. The Jew whom Khapun
has already spotted through the window
feels the devil&#8217;s claws sinking into his back. Ugh!
It makes one&#8217;s flesh creep even to tell of it, so
just think what the poor Jew must feel! Of course
he yells as loud as ever he can. But who can hear
him when all the rest of them are yelling like lunatics,
too? And maybe one of his neighbours does hear
him, and is only glad it isn&#8217;t himself who is in such
a sorry plight.</p>

<p>Kharko himself had heard more than once the pitiful,
clear, long-drawn notes of a trumpet floating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
out over the city. It was a novice in the synagogue
trumpeting out a farewell call to his unfortunate
brother, while the rest of the Jews were putting on
their shoes in the entry&mdash;Jews always go into church
in their stocking feet&mdash;or standing in little groups in
the moonlight, whispering together on tip-toe, staring
up at the sky. And when the last man has gone,
one lonely pair of shoes is left lying in the entry,
waiting for its owner. Ah, those shoes will have to
wait a long time, for at that very moment Khapun is
flying with their owner high over woods and fields,
over valleys and hills and plains, flapping his wings,
and keeping well out of sight of Christian eyes. The
accursed one is glad when the night is cloudy and
dark. But when it is clear and still like to-night,
with the moon shining as bright as day, the devil&#8217;s
work may very well come to naught.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221; asked the miller, trembling lest the
talkative Kharko should begin poking insults at him
again. But this time the servant answered quietly
enough:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, any Christian, no matter if he&#8217;s
stupid, like you, can call to the devil: &#8216;Drop it!
It is mine!&#8217; and Khapun will drop the Jew at once.
The devil will flutter his wings, and fly away with a
shrill cry like a wounded hawk, to be left without
prey for a year. The Jew will fall to the ground.
It will be lucky for him if he wasn&#8217;t too high up and
if he falls into a bog or some other soft spot. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
he doesn&#8217;t, no one will profit by his fall, neither
he nor the devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s how it is!&#8221; said the miller, staring nervously
at the sky, in which the moon was shining with
all its might. The heavens were clear; only one
little cloudlet like a bit of black down was flying
swiftly along between the moon and the wood that
shrouded the river bank. It was a cloud, of course,
but one thing about it seemed strange to the miller.
Not a breath of wind was stirring, the leaves on the
bushes were motionless as if in a trance, and yet the
cloud was flying like a bird straight toward the
city.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here; let me show you something!&#8221; the miller
called to the servant.</p>

<p>Kharko came out of the inn, and leaning against
the door post, said calmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is it? A fine thing you have found
to show me! That&#8217;s a cloud, that is; let it alone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take another look at it! Is there any wind blowing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, well! That <i>is</i> funny!&#8221; said the servant,
perplexed. &#8220;It&#8217;s making straight for the city,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>And both men scratched their heads and craned
their necks.</p>

<p>The same humming sounds came to their ears
through the window as before; the miller caught a
glimpse of lugubrious yellow faces, closed eyes, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
motionless lips. The little Jews were crying and
wriggling, and once more the miller seemed to see an
alien presence in them weeping and praying for
something unknown, long lost, and already half
forgotten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I must be going home,&#8221; said the miller,
collecting his wits. &#8220;And yet I wanted to pay Yankel
a few copecks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. I can take them for him,&#8221; said
the servant, without looking at the miller.</p>

<p>But the miller pretended not to have heard this
last remark. The sum was not so small that he
cared to intrust it to a servant, much less to a vagabond
soldier. With a sum like that the fellow might
easily kick up his heels, as the saying is, and run
away, not only out of the village, but even out of
the District. If he did that, look for the wind in
the fields, you would find it sooner than Kharko!</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night!&#8221; said the miller at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night! And I&#8217;ll take the money if you&#8217;ll
give it to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother; I can give it to him myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as you like. But if I took it you wouldn&#8217;t be
bothered about it any more. Well, well, it&#8217;s time to
close the inn. You&#8217;re the last dog that&#8217;ll be round
to-night, I&#8217;ll be bound.&#8221;</p>

<p>The servant scratched his back on the door post,
whistled not very agreeably after the miller, and
bolted the door on which were depicted in white paint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
a quart measure, a wine-glass, and a tin mug. Meanwhile
the miller descended the hill, and walked down
the road in his long white overcoat, with his coal-black
shadow running beside him as before.</p>

<p>But the miller was not thinking of his shadow now.
His thoughts were of something far different.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The miller had not gone more than a hundred
yards when he heard a rustling and fluttering that
sounded like two large birds taking flight from behind
the hedge. But it was not a pair of birds; it
was only a lad and a lass, startled by the miller&#8217;s sudden
appearance out of the darkness. The lad, it
seemed, was not to be frightened. Creeping into
the shadows so that the two white figures were barely
visible under the cherry trees, he put his arm firmly
around the girl, and continued his low-toned discourse.
A few yards farther on the miller heard
something that halted him with annoyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, you there! I don&#8217;t know what your name
is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he cried. &#8220;But you might wait until I had
gone by to do your kissing. Your smacks can be
heard all over the village.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he walked right up to the hedge.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cur you, what do you mean by poking
your nose into other people&#8217;s affairs?&#8221; a lad answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
out of the darkness. &#8220;Wait a minute, I&#8217;ll
kiss you on the nose with my fist! I&#8217;ll teach you to
interfere with people!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, never mind!&#8221; said the miller, stepping
back. &#8220;One would think you were doing something
important! You&#8217;re a bad lad, you are, to
smack a girl like that; you make a man envious. Oh,
what are people coming to!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood still for a moment, thought a bit,
scratched his head, and finally turned aside, threw his
leg over the hedge, and crossed a field to a widow&#8217;s
cottage that stood a little way back from the road
in the shade of a tall poplar tree.</p>

<p>The khata was a tiny, lop-sided affair, crumbling
and falling to pieces. Its one little window was so
minute that it would have been almost invisible had
the night been at all dark. But now the whole cottage
was glowing in the moonlight; its straw roof
was shining like gold, its walls seemed to be made of
silver, and the little window was blinking like a dark
eye.</p>

<p>No light shone behind it. Probably the old woman
and her daughter had no fuel and nothing to cook for
supper.</p>

<p>The miller paused a moment, then knocked twice
at the window and went a few steps aside.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait before two plump girlish
arms were wound tightly around his neck, and something
glowed among his whiskers that felt very much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
like two lips pressed to his mouth. Hey ho, what
more is there to tell! If you have ever been kissed
like that you know yourself how it feels. If you
haven&#8217;t, it&#8217;s no use trying to tell you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Philipko, my darling for whom I have
longed!&#8221; crooned the girl. &#8220;You have come, you
have come! And I have been waiting so wearily for
you. I thought I should parch up with longing, like
grass without water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh hey, she hasn&#8217;t parched up, though, thank
God!&#8221; thought the miller, as he pressed the girl&#8217;s not
emaciated form to his breast. &#8220;Thank God, she is
all right yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when shall we have the wedding, Philip?&#8221;
asked the girl with her hands still lying on Philip&#8217;s
shoulders, while she devoured him with burning eyes
as dark as an autumn night. &#8220;Saint Philip&#8217;s day
will soon be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>This speech was less to the miller&#8217;s liking than the
girl&#8217;s kisses.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s what she&#8217;s driving at!&#8221; thought he.
&#8220;Ah, Philip, Philip, now you&#8217;re going to catch it!&#8221;</p>

<p>But he summoned all the courage he had, and,
turning his eyes away, answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a hurry you&#8217;re in, Galya, I declare! Thinking
about the wedding already, are you? How can
we get married when I am a miller and may soon be
the richest man in the village, and you are only a
poor widow&#8217;s daughter?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>The girl staggered back at these words as if a
snake had bitten her. She jumped away from Philip
and laid her hand on her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I thought&mdash;oh, my poor head&mdash;then why
did you knock at the window, you wicked man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh hey!&#8221; answered the miller. &#8220;You ask why I
knocked. Why shouldn&#8217;t I knock when your mother
owes me money? And then you come jumping out
and begin to kiss me. What can I do? I know
how to kiss as well as any man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And he stretched out his hand toward her again,
but the moment he touched the girl&#8217;s body she started
as if an insect had stung her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get away!&#8221; she screamed, so angrily that the miller
fell back a step. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a rouble bill that you
can lay your hands on as if I belonged to you. If
you come back again I&#8217;ll warm you up so that you&#8217;ll
forget how to make love for three years.&#8221;</p>

<p>The miller was taken aback.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a little firebrand it is! Do you think I&#8217;m a
Jew that you howl at me so hatefully?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re not a Jew, then what are you? You
charge half a rouble for every rouble you lend, and
then you come to me for interest besides! Get away,
I tell you, you horrid brute!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my girl!&#8221; said the miller, nervously covering
his face with his hand as if she had really hit him with
her fist. &#8220;I see it&#8217;s no use for a sensible man to talk
to you. Go and send your mother to me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>But the old woman had already come out of the
hut, and was making a low curtsey to the miller.
Philip enjoyed this more than he had the words of the
girl. He stuck his arms akimbo, and the head of his
black shadow rubbed so hard against the wall that he
wondered his hat didn&#8217;t come off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what I&#8217;ve come for, old woman?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how should I not know, poor wretch that I
am! You have come for my money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha, not <i>your</i> money, old woman!&#8221; the miller
laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a robber; I don&#8217;t come at night
and take money that isn&#8217;t mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you <i>have</i> come for money that isn&#8217;t yours!&#8221;
retorted Galya, angrily falling upon the miller. &#8220;You
<i>have</i> come for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crazy girl!&#8221; exclaimed the miller, stepping back.
&#8220;Upon my word there isn&#8217;t another girl in the whole
village as crazy as you are. And not in the village
alone, in the whole District. Just think a minute
what you have said! If it weren&#8217;t for your mother,
who probably wouldn&#8217;t testify against you, I&#8217;d have
you up in court before Christmas for cheating
me. Come, think a little what you&#8217;re doing, girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why need I think when I&#8217;m doing right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can it be right for the old woman to borrow
money from me and not pay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You lie! You lie like a dog! You came courting
me when you were still a workman at the mill; you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
came to our khata and never said a word about wanting
anything in return. And then, when your uncle
died and you came to be a miller yourself, you collected
the whole debt, and now even that won&#8217;t satisfy
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the flour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what about the flour? How much do you
ask for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixty copecks a pood, not less! No one would let
you have it cheaper than that, no, not if you threw
your precious self in with it into the bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how much have you already collected from
us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut, how she does talk! You&#8217;ve a tongue in
your head as bad as Kharko&#8217;s, girl. I&#8217;ll answer that
by asking you for the interest. Have you paid it?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Galya was silent. It is often that way with
girls. They talk and talk and rattle along like a mill
with all its stones grinding, and then they suddenly
stop dead. You&#8217;d think they had run short of water.
That&#8217;s how Galya did. She burst into a flood of
bitter tears, and went away wiping her eyes on the
wide sleeve of her blouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;There now!&#8221; said the miller, a little confused but
satisfied in his heart. &#8220;That&#8217;s what comes of attacking
people. If you hadn&#8217;t begun shouting at me
there wouldn&#8217;t have been anything to cry for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue! Hold your tongue, you foul
creature!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>&#8220;Hold your own tongue, if that&#8217;s what you think!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet, be quiet, my honey!&#8221; the mother joined
in, heaving a deep sigh. The old woman was evidently
afraid of irritating the miller; it was clear
she could not pay him now that her time was up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be quiet, mother, I won&#8217;t, I won&#8217;t!&#8221; answered
the girl, as if all the wheels in her mill had
begun turning again. &#8220;I won&#8217;t be quiet; and if you
want to know, I&#8217;m going to scratch out his eyes so
that he won&#8217;t dare to get me gossiped about for nothing,
and come knocking at my window and kissing me!
Tell me what you meant by knocking, or I&#8217;ll catch
you by the top-knot without stopping to ask if you
are a miller and a rich man or not. You never used
to be proud like that; you came courting me yourself
and pouring out tender words. But now you
hold your nose so high that your hat won&#8217;t stay on
your head!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, honey, honey, do be quiet, my poor dear little
orphan!&#8221; begged the old woman with another grievous
sigh. &#8220;And you, Mr. Miller, don&#8217;t think ill of
the poor silly girl. Young hearts and young wisdom
are mates; they are like new beer in a ferment.
They boil and foam, but if you will let them stand
awhile they will grow sweet to a man&#8217;s taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I care?&#8221; answered the miller. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
ask for either bitter or sweet from her, because you
are not my equals, either of you. Give me the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
money, old woman, and I&#8217;ll never come near your
khata again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Okh, but we have no money! Wait a little; we
will work for some, my daughter and I, and then we
will pay you. Oh, misery me, Philipko, dearie, what
a time I do have with you and with her! You know
yourself I have loved you like a son; I never thought,
I never guessed, you would cast my debts in my teeth
and with the interest, too! Oh, if I could only get my
daughter married! A good husband would be easy to
find, but she won&#8217;t have any one. Ever since you
have come courting the girl you seem to have cast
a spell over her. &#8216;I&#8217;d rather be buried in the cold
ground than marry any one else,&#8217; she says. I was
foolish ever to let you stay here until dawn. Oi,
misery me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what can I do?&#8221; asked the miller. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t understand these things, old woman. A rich
man has many calls on his money. I pay the Jew
what I owe him; now you must pay me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait just one month!&#8221;</p>

<p>The miller rubbed his head and reflected. He
felt a little sorry for the old woman, and Galya&#8217;s
embroidered blouse was gleaming in the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then, only I&#8217;ll have to add thirty
copecks to the debt for interest. You&#8217;d better pay
at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I do? It&#8217;s my fate not to pay, I can
see that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll leave it at that. I&#8217;m not a
Jew. I&#8217;m a decent sort of a fellow. Any one else
would have charged you forty copecks at least, I
know that for certain, and I&#8217;m only asking you
twenty, and shall wait till St. Philip&#8217;s day for the
money. But then you will have to look out. If you
don&#8217;t pay, I&#8217;ll complain about you to the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words he turned, bowed, and walked
away across the pasture, without so much as a glance
at the hut at whose door there shone for a long
time a white embroidered blouse. It shone against
the dark shade of the cherry trees like a little white
star, and the miller could not see the black eyes
weeping, the white arms stretched out toward him,
the young breast sighing for his sake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, my honey; don&#8217;t cry, my sugar-plum!&#8221;
the old woman soothed her child. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
cry, it&#8217;s God&#8217;s will, my darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Okh, mother, mother, if only you had let me
scratch out his eyes, perhaps I should feel better!&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>After that adventure the miller&#8217;s thoughts became
gloomier than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somehow nothing ever goes right in this world,&#8221;
he said to himself. &#8220;Unpleasant things are always
happening, a man never knows why. For instance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
that girl there drove me away. She called me a
Jew. If I were a Jew and had as much money as
I have and a business like mine, would I live as I
do? Of course not! Look what my life is! I work
in the mill myself; I don&#8217;t half sleep by night; I
don&#8217;t half eat by day; I keep my eye on the water
to see it doesn&#8217;t run out; I keep my eye on the stones
to see they don&#8217;t come loose; I keep my eye on the
shafts and the pinions and the cogs to see they run
smoothly and don&#8217;t miss a stroke. Yes, and I keep
my eye on that infernal workman of mine. How
can one depend on a servant? If I turn my back for
an instant the scoundrel runs off after the girls.
Yes, a miller&#8217;s life is a dog&#8217;s life, it is! Of course,
though, ever since my uncle&mdash;God rest his soul&mdash;fell
into the mill-pond drunk, and the mill came to
me, the money has been collecting in my pockets.
But what&#8217;s the result? Don&#8217;t I have to tramp for
hours after every single rouble I make, and get
abused for it to my face, yes, to my very face? And
how much do I get in the end? A trifle! A Christian
never does get as much as a Jew. Now if only the
devil would carry away that Jew Yankel I might
be able to manage. The people wouldn&#8217;t go to any
one but me then, whether they wanted flour or money
for taxes. Oho! In that case I might even open a
little inn, and then I could either get some one to
run the mill for me, or else sell it. Bother the mill,
say I! Somehow a man isn&#8217;t a man as long as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
has to work. The fact is, one copeck begets another.
Only fools don&#8217;t know that. If you buy
yourself a pair of pigs, for instance&mdash;pigs are prolific
animals&mdash;in a year you&#8217;ll have a herd of them,
and money&#8217;s just the same. If you put it out to
pasture among stupid folk you can sit still and
yawn until the time comes to drive it home. Every
copeck will have brought forth ten copecks, every
rouble will have brought forth ten roubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>The miller had now reached the crest of a hill
from where the road sloped gently to the river.
From here, when the night breeze breathed into his
face, he could faintly hear the sleepy water murmuring
in the mill-race. Looking behind him, the
miller could see the village sleeping among its gardens,
and the widow&#8217;s little khata under its tall poplars.
He stood plunged in thought for a few moments,
scratching the back of his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, what a fool I am!&#8221; he said at last, resuming
his journey. &#8220;If my uncle hadn&#8217;t taken it into
his head to get drunk on gorelka and walk into the
mill-pond I might have been married to Galya to-day,
but now she&#8217;s beneath me. Okh, but that girl is
sweet to kiss! Goodness, how sweet she is! That&#8217;s
why I say that nothing ever goes right in this world.
If that little face had a nice dowry behind it, if it
had even as much as old Makogon is giving away
with his Motria, there would be nothing more to be
said!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>He cast one last look behind him, and turned on
his way, when suddenly the stroke of a bell resounded
from the village. Something seemed to have fallen
from the church steeple that rose from a hill in
the centre of the town, and to be flying, clanging
and rocking, across the fields.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, hey, it is midnight on earth,&#8221; the miller
mused, and with a great yawn he turned and walked
rapidly down the hill, thinking of his flock as he
went. He saw his roubles as if they had been alive,
passing from hand to hand and from business to
business, grazing and multiplying. He laughed to
recall that some fools thought they worked for
themselves. And when the time was ripe, he, the
owner of the flock, would drive it and its increase
back into his iron chest.</p>

<p>These thoughts were all pleasant ones, but the
recollection of the Jew spoilt them again. The miller
was provoked because that son of Israel had seized
all the grazing for himself, leaving his poor roubles
nowhere to feed and nothing to grow fat on, like
a flock of sheep in a field where Jewish goats had
already been pasturing. Every one knew they never
could fatten there!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish the devil would get him, the foul
brute!&#8221; the miller said to himself, and he decided
it was the thought of the Jew that depressed him
so. That&#8217;s what was wrong with the world. Those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
infernal Jews prevented Christians from collecting
their lawful profits.</p>

<p>Half way down the hill, where the peaceful, drowsy
sound of the water in the mill-race came unintermittently
to his ears, the miller suddenly stopped and
struck his forehead with the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! What a joke it would be! It would be a
grand joke, I swear! This the Day of Atonement.
What if the Hebrew devil should take a fancy to
our inn-keeper Yankel? But he won&#8217;t! It couldn&#8217;t
possibly happen. The town is crammed with Jews,
and Yankel is a tipsy old wretch, as bony as a
hedgehog. Who would want him? No,&#8221; thought the
miller, &#8220;I&#8217;m not lucky enough for Khapun to choose
our Yankel out of thousands of others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, like a nest of ants in a turmoil, another
train of thought began to pass through his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Philip, Philip!&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
right for a Christian to think such things! Recollect
yourself! Yankel would leave children behind
him, as well as debts. And another reason why it
is sinful: Yankel has never done you any harm. If
others have reason to blame the old inn-keeper, you
yourself are not guiltless of usury.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the miller hastily sent other and angrier
thoughts to attack these last unpleasant reflections
that had begun to bite his conscience like vicious
dogs.</p>

<p>&#8220;But after all, a Sheeny is only a Sheeny, and isn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
in the same class with Christians at all. Even if
I do lend money&mdash;and I do, there&#8217;s no use denying it&mdash;it&#8217;s
better for Christians to pay interest to a
brother Christian than to a heathen Jew.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment the last notes of the bell pealed
out from the belfry.</p>

<p>Probably Ivan Kadilo, the bell-ringer, had gone
to sleep in the church and had pulled the bell rope in
his sleep, so long had he taken to sound the hour
of midnight. To atone for his neglect, this last tug
was so violent that the miller actually jumped as
the sound came rolling over the hill, over his head,
across the river, across the wood, and away over the
distant fields through which wound the road to the
city.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every one is asleep now,&#8221; the miller thought,
and something gripped his heart. &#8220;Every one is
asleep where he wants to be; all but the Jews crowded
weeping into their churches, and I, who am standing
here by my mill-pond like a lost soul, thinking
wicked thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p>And everything seemed very strange to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear the sound of the bell dying away over
the fields,&#8221; thought he, &#8220;and I feel as if something
invisible were running, moaning, through the country.
I see the woods beyond the river drenched with dew
and shining in the moonlight, and I begin to wonder
why they should be covered with frost on a summer&#8217;s
night. And when I remember that my uncle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
was drowned in that pond, and how glad I was
that it happened, I seem to lose heart entirely. I
don&#8217;t know whether to go down to the mill or to
stay where I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gavrilo! Hey, Gavrilo!&#8221; he shouted at last.
&#8220;There now! The mill is empty, and that scamp
has made off to the village again after the girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip stepped out into a bright spot of moonlight
on the dam, and stood listening to the water
trickling through the sluices. It seemed to him to
be stealing out of the pond and creeping toward
the mill-wheels.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had better go to bed,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll
see that everything is all right first.&#8221;</p>

<p>The moon had long since climbed to the zenith, and
was looking down into the water. The miller wondered
that the little river should be deep enough to
hold the moon, and the dark blue sky with all its
stars, and the little black cloudlet that was flying
along all alone like a bit of down from the direction
of the city.</p>

<p>But as his eyes were already half blind with sleep
he did not wonder long. Having opened the outer
door of the mill and bolted it again from the inside
so that he should hear his reprobate workman when
he came home, he lay down to sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo, get up, Philip!&#8221; he suddenly thought to
himself, and he jumped out of bed in the darkness as
if some one had hit him with an axe. &#8220;I forgot that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
that little cloud was the same one the Jew&#8217;s servant
and I saw flying toward the city, and wondered as we
watched it how it could move without wind. There
isn&#8217;t much wind now, and what there is isn&#8217;t coming
from that quarter. Wait a minute, Philip, there&#8217;s
something queer about this!&#8221;</p>

<p>The miller was very sleepy, but, nevertheless, he
went out barefoot on to the dam, and stood in the
middle of it scratching his chest and back (the
mill was not free from fleas). A light breeze was
blowing from the mill-pond behind him, and yet there
was that little cloud flying directly in his face. Only
it now no longer looked feathery-light, neither did it
fly as swiftly and freely as before. It seemed to be
swaying a little and falling to earth like a wounded
bird. As it flew across the moon the miller at last
saw very clearly what it was, for against that bright
orb were silhouetted a pair of dark, flapping wings,
and below them was hanging a human form with
a long, quivering beard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha, here&#8217;s a pretty to do!&#8221; thought the miller.
&#8220;He&#8217;s carrying one of them away. What shall I
do? If I shout to him: drop it, it is mine! the poor
Jew may break his neck or fall into the pond. He&#8217;s
pretty high up.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he soon saw that the situation was changing.
The devil was circling over the mill with his burden,
and beginning to sink to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was greedy and chose a morsel too big for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
him,&#8221; the miller said to himself. &#8220;Now I can rescue
the Jew; he&#8217;s a living soul, after all, and isn&#8217;t to
be compared to a devil. Come then, God bless me,
let me shout my loudest!&#8221;</p>

<p>But instead of shouting he strangely enough ran
away from the dam as fast as his legs could carry
him, and hid under the sycamores that stood like
nixies at the edge of the mill-pond, bathing their
green branches in its dark water. The darkness was
as deep under them as in a barrel, and the miller felt
sure that no one could see him. To tell the honest
truth, his teeth were chattering madly and his hands
and feet were trembling as the shafts trembled when
his mill was running. Nevertheless, he couldn&#8217;t resist
the temptation of peeping out to see what would
happen next.</p>

<p>First the devil fell almost to earth with his prey,
and then rose again above the tree-tops, but it was
plain to see that his load was too heavy for him.
Twice he actually touched the water, so that the
ripples spread in circles from the Jew&#8217;s feet, but
each time he flapped his wings, and rose again with his
prey as a sea-gull rises from the water with a heavy
fish. At last, after circling about two or three times,
the devil fell heavily on to the dam, and lay as if
dead, with the fainting Jew inanimate at his side.</p>

<p>And I must tell you&mdash;I had nearly forgotten it&mdash;that
our friend the miller had long ago seen whom
the Jewish Khapun had brought from the city. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
when he recognised him&mdash;need I conceal it when he
has confessed it himself?&mdash;he grew merry at heart
and thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, it is no other than our inn-keeper
from Novokamensk! What happens next is none
of my business, because I don&#8217;t think I ought to
interfere in other people&#8217;s affairs. When two dogs
are fighting there&#8217;s no reason a third should jump
in. Again I say, let sleeping dogs lie. What if I
hadn&#8217;t have happened to be here? I&#8217;m not the Jew&#8217;s
guardian.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he also thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha, Philipko, now your time has come in Novokamensk!&#8221;</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Both the unfortunate Jew and the devil lay motionless
on the dam for a long time. The moon had
begun to redden, and was hanging above the tree-tops
as if only waiting to see what the end would
be before setting. A hoarse cock crowed in the
village, and a dog yelped twice. But no other cocks
or dogs answered these two; it evidently still lacked
some hours to dawn.</p>

<p>The miller was exhausted, and was already beginning
to think it had all been a dream, especially as
the dam now lay wrapped in profoundest darkness,
so that it was impossible to distinguish what the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
black object lying upon it was. But when the solitary
cock-crow resounded from the village the dark
mass stirred. Yankel raised his head in its skull-cap,
looked about him, got up, and began to steal softly
away, stepping high like a stork with his thin legs,
in his stocking-feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, there! Stop him; he&#8217;s making off!&#8221; the
startled miller came near shouting, but next moment
he saw the devil catch Yankel by his long coat-tails.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a bit!&#8221; Khapun cried. &#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of
time yet. What a hurry you&#8217;re in! Here you are
wanting to be off again before I&#8217;ve had time to rest!
It&#8217;s all right for you, but what about me, who have
to drag a big fellow like you along? I&#8217;m nearly
dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; said the Jew, trying to free his
coat-tails from the devil&#8217;s grasp. &#8220;Rest a little
longer, and I&#8217;ll walk to my inn on foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>The devil jumped up in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you&#8217;re saying?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Do you
think I have hired myself out to you as a cart to
take you home from church, you hound? You must
be joking!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I be joking?&#8221; asked the wily Yankel,
pretending to have no idea what the Devil wanted
with him. &#8220;I am very grateful indeed to you for
having brought me so far, and I can now go on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
quite well by myself. It is only a short way. I
wouldn&#8217;t think of troubling you any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The devil quivered with rage. He ran round and
round on the same spot like a chicken with its head
off, and knocked Yankel down with his wing. He
was panting like a blacksmith&#8217;s bellows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; the miller thought. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
care if it is sin to admire a devil, I do admire this
one; he would never let his lawful property slip
between his fingers, one can see that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yankel sat up and began to yell with all his
might. Even the devil could do nothing to stop
him. Every one knows that as long as a Jew has
a breath in his body nothing will make him hold
his tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it matter, though?&#8221; thought the
miller, looking round at his empty mill. &#8220;My man
is either amusing himself with the girls or else lying
drunk under a hedge.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sleepy frog in the mud answered Yankel&#8217;s pitiful
screams with a croak, and a bittern, that foul
bird of the night, boomed twice as if from an empty
barrel: boo-oo, boo-oo! The moon had finally sunk
behind the wood, assured that the Jew was dead
and done for; darkness had fallen upon the mill, the
dam, and the river, and a white mist had gathered
over the pond.</p>

<p>The devil carelessly shook his wings, and lay down
again, saying with a laugh:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>&#8220;Scream as loud as you like! The mill is deserted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know it&#8217;s deserted?&#8221; snapped the
Jew, and he began to scream for the miller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Miller! Oi, Mr. Miller! Golden, silver,
diamond Mr. Miller! Please, please come here for
one little tiny second and say three words, three
little tiny words! I&#8217;ll make you a present of half
the debt you owe me if you&#8217;ll only come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll make me a present of the whole debt!&#8221;
said a voice in the miller&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>The Jew stopped screaming, his head sank forward
on his breast, and he burst into a fit of bitter
weeping.</p>

<p>Again some time passed. The moon had now
set, and its last rays had died out of the sky. Everything
in heaven and on earth seemed wrapped
in the deepest slumber; not a sound could be
heard except the Jew&#8217;s low weeping and his exclamations
of:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my Sarah! Oh, my poor children! My
poor little children!&#8221;</p>

<p>The devil felt a little rested, and sat up. Although
it was dark, the miller could distinctly see a pair of
horns like a young calf&#8217;s outlined against the white
mist that hung over the pond.</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks just like ours!&#8221; thought the miller,
feeling as if he had swallowed something exceedingly
cold.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>Then he saw the Jew nudge the devil with his
elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you nudging me for?&#8221; asked Khapun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh, I want to tell you something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you please tell me why it is your custom
always to carry off a poor Jew? Why don&#8217;t you
catch a daintier morsel? For instance, there is
an excellent miller living right here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The devil sighed deeply. Perhaps he was tired
of sitting there on the edge of the pond by the empty
mill; anyhow, he entered into conversation with the
Jew. He raised his skull-cap&mdash;you must know that
he wore a skull-cap with long ringlets hanging from
underneath it, just as the servant had described him&mdash;and
scratched his crown with a rasping noise like
the most savage of cats clawing a board when a
mouse has escaped it. Then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, Yankel, you don&#8217;t know our business! I
couldn&#8217;t possibly approach him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why, may I ask, would you have to take the
time to approach him? I know for myself that you
snatched me away before I could even yell.&#8221;</p>

<p>The devil laughed so merrily that he actually
frightened a night-bird out of the reeds, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fact! You were easy to catch. And
do you know why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why-y?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re a good lusty catcher yourself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
I assure you there&#8217;s no other race on earth as sinful
as you Jews.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, vei, that is most surprising! And what are
our sins?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen and I shall tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The devil turned to the Jew and began counting
on his fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Number one. You are usurers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One,&#8221; repeated Yankel, also counting on his
fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Number two. You live by the blood and sweat
of the people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Number three. You sell the people vodka.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Number four. You dilute it with water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let number four go! And what is the next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are four sins so few? Ah, Yankel, Yankel!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t say four are few, I only say that
you don&#8217;t know your own business. Do you think
the miller isn&#8217;t a usurer, do you think the miller
doesn&#8217;t live by the sweat and blood of the people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, now, don&#8217;t pick at the miller! He&#8217;s not
that kind of a man&mdash;he&#8217;s a Christian. A Christian
is supposed to have pity not only on his own people
but on others, too, even on Jews like you. That&#8217;s
why it&#8217;s so hard for me to catch a Christian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, vei, what a mistake you make there!&#8221; cried
the Jew gaily. &#8220;Here, let me tell you something&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>He jumped up, and the devil rose too; they stood
facing one another. The Jew whispered something
in the devil&#8217;s ear, motioning toward some object
behind him under the sycamore tree. He pointed it
out to the devil with his crooked forefinger.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s number one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lying; it can&#8217;t be true!&#8221; the devil answered,
a little startled, peering toward the trees
where Philip was hiding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha, I know better! Just wait a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more he whispered something, and then said
aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Number two! And this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; again he whispered
in the devil&#8217;s ear. &#8220;Makes three, as I am an honest
Jew!&#8221;</p>

<p>The devil shook his head and answered doubtfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make a bet. If I am right you shall let
me go free when a year is up, and repay me my losses
into the bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! I agree. What a joke it would be! Then
I should try my power&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting a fine bargain, I can tell you!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment the cock in the village crowed
once more, and although his voice was so sleepy that
again no other bird answered him out of the silent
night, Khapun shuddered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, what am I standing here gaping at you for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
while you tell me tales? A bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush. Come along!&#8221;</p>

<p>He flapped his wings, flew a few feet along the
dam, and once more fell upon poor Yankel like a
hawk, burying his claws in the back of his shirt,
and preparing to take flight.</p>

<p>Alas, how piteously old Yankel screamed, stretching
out his arms toward the village and his native
hut, calling his wife and children by name!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, my Sarah! Oi, Shlemka, Iteley, Movshey!
Oi, Mr. Miller, Mr. Miller! Please, please save
me! Say the three words! I see you; there you
are, standing under the sycamore tree. Have pity
on a poor Jew! He has a living soul like you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Very, very piteous were poor Yankel&#8217;s lamentations!
Icy fingers seemed to clutch the miller&#8217;s heart
and squeeze it until it ached. The devil seemed to
be waiting for something, his wings fluttered like the
wings of a young bustard that has not learnt to
fly. He hovered silently over the dam with Yankel
in his talons.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a wretch that devil is!&#8221; thought the miller,
hiding farther under the trees. &#8220;He is only tormenting
the poor Jew. If the cocks should crow
again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardly had that thought entered his head than
the devil laughed till the wood rang, and suddenly
sprang aloft into the sky. The miller peered upward,
but in a few seconds the devil appeared no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
larger than a sparrow. Then he glimmered for a
moment like a fly, then like a gnat, and at last
disappeared.</p>

<p>Then the miller was seized with genuine terror.
His knees knocked together, his teeth chattered, his
hair stood on end so high that, had he been wearing
a hat, it would certainly have been knocked off his
head. He never could say exactly what he did next.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Bang&mdash;bang!</p>

<p>Bang&mdash;bang&mdash;bang! Bang&mdash;bang!</p>

<p>Some one was knocking so loudly at the door of
the mill that the whole building was filled with noisy
echoes that reverberated in every corner. The miller
thought the devil might have come back&mdash;he and
the Jew had not whispered together for nothing!&mdash;so
he only buried his head under the pillow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bang&mdash;bang! Bang&mdash;bang! Hey, master, unlock
the door!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The miller raised his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that sounds like Gavrilo&#8217;s voice. Gavrilo,
is that you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who else should it be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Swear that it&#8217;s you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>&#8220;Swear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then, I swear it&#8217;s me. How could I
not be myself? And yet you want me to swear it!
There&#8217;s a marvel for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even then the miller wouldn&#8217;t believe him. He went
upstairs and peeped out of a window over the door,
and there beneath him stood Gavrilo. The miller
was much relieved and went down to open the door.</p>

<p>Gavrilo was actually staggered when the miller
appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, master, what has happened to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why on earth have you smeared your face all
over with flour? You&#8217;re as white as chalk!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you come across the river?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And didn&#8217;t you look up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And didn&#8217;t you see some one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who? Fool! The creature that nabbed Yankel
the inn-keeper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who the devil nabbed him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, indeed? Why, the Jewish devil, Khapun.
Don&#8217;t you know what day this has been?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gavrilo looked at the miller with troubled eyes
and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been to the village this evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>&#8220;Did you stop at the inn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you drink any gorelka?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah, what&#8217;s the use of talking to a fool? I did
have some gorelka at the priest&#8217;s, but all the same I
have just seen with my own eyes the devil resting
on the dam with the Jew in his claws.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right there, in the middle of the dam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what happened next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; the miller whistled and
waved his hand in the air.</p>

<p>Gavrilo stared at the dam, scratched his top-knot,
and looked up at the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a marvel for you! What&#8217;ll we do now?
How can we get along without the Jew?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so anxious to have a Jew here,
hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t only me. One can&#8217;t&mdash;oh, don&#8217;t argue
about it, master, things wouldn&#8217;t be the same without
a Jew; one couldn&#8217;t get along without one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut! What a fool you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you scolding me for? I don&#8217;t say I&#8217;m
clever, but I know millet from buckwheat. I work
in the mill, but I drink vodka at the tavern. Tell
me, as you&#8217;re so clever, who will be our inn-keeper
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, who?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>&#8220;Perhaps I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gavrilo stared at the miller with his eyes starting
out of his head. Then he shook his head, clicked
his tongue, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;So, that&#8217;s your idea!&#8221;</p>

<p>The miller now noticed for the first time that
Gavrilo was very uncertain on his legs and that the
lads had given him another black eye. To tell the
truth, the fellow looked so ugly and pale that you
wanted to spit at the sight of him. He was a great
hand with the girls, and the lads had more than
once fallen upon him. Whenever they caught him
they were sure to beat him almost to death. Of
course it was no wonder they beat him; the wonder
was there was ever anything for which to do it!</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no face in the world so ugly but some
girl will fall in love with it,&#8221; thought the miller.
&#8220;But they love him by threes and fours and dozens.
Ugh! You scarecrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Gavrilo, boy,&#8221; he nevertheless said in a
coaxing voice, &#8220;come and sleep with me. When a
man has seen what I have he feels a bit nervous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, it&#8217;s all the same to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A minute later a certain workman was whistling
through his nose. And let me tell you, I spent the
night at the mill once myself, and I have never heard
any one whistle through his nose as Gavrilo did. If
a man didn&#8217;t like it he had better not spend the night<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
in the same house with him or he wouldn&#8217;t sleep a
wink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gavrilo!&#8221; said the miller. &#8220;Hey, Gavrilo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, what is it? If I couldn&#8217;t sleep myself
at least I wouldn&#8217;t keep others awake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they beat you again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What if they did?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to know everything, don&#8217;t you? In
Konda.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Konda? Why did you go there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because! What else do you want to know? Hee,
hee, hee!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t there girls enough for you in Novokamensk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! It makes me sick to look at them. There
isn&#8217;t one there that suits me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about Galya, the widow&#8217;s daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Galya? What do I care about Galya?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, have you been courting her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I have; what do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>The miller flounced over in bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lying, you hound; a plague seize your
mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not lying and I never lie. I leave that to
cleverer men than I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gavrilo yawned and said in a sleepy voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember, master, how my right eye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
was so swelled up for a week that you couldn&#8217;t even
see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That devil&#8217;s child entertained me by doing that.
Confound her, say I! Galya, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s how things are, is it?&#8221; thought the
miller. &#8220;Gavrilo! Hey, Gavrilo! Oh, the hound,
he&#8217;s snoring again&mdash;Gavrilo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>do</i> you want? Have you gone crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to get married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t made my boots yet. When I&#8217;ve made
my boots I&#8217;ll think about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;d give you boots, and tar for them, and a
hat and a belt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you? And I&#8217;ll tell you something better
still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the cocks are already crowing in the village.
Can&#8217;t you hear them going it?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was true. In the village, perhaps at Galya&#8217;s
cottage, a shrill-voiced cock was splitting his throat
shouting &#8220;cock-a-doodle-doo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cock-a-doodle-doo!&#8221; answered other voices from
far and near like water boiling in a kettle, and all
the cracks in the wall of the little room began to
gleam white, even down to the tiniest chink.</p>

<p>The miller yawned blissfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now they are far away!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;How
funny it was! He flew all the way from the city to my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
mill while the clock was striking twelve. Ha, ha,
and so Yankel has gone! What a joke! Why, if I
should tell it to any one, they&#8217;d call me a liar. But
why should I lie? They&#8217;ll find it out for themselves
to-morrow. Perhaps I&#8217;d better not mention it at all.
They would say I ought to have&mdash;but what&#8217;s the use
of arguing about it? If I had killed the Jew myself,
or anything like that, I should have been responsible
for what happened, but as it is, it doesn&#8217;t concern me
at all. What need had I to interfere? Let sleeping
dogs lie, say I. A shut mouth plays safe. They
won&#8217;t hear anything from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Philip the miller reasoned with himself, and
tried to ease his conscience a little. It was only as
he was on the verge of falling asleep that a thought
crept out of some recess of his brain like a toad
out of a hole, and that thought was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Philip, now&#8217;s your time!&#8221;</p>

<p>This thought chased all the others out of his mind
and took possession of it.</p>

<p>With it he went to sleep.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Early next morning, while the dew is still glittering
on the grass, behold the miller dressed and on his
way to the village. He found the people there buzzing
like bees in a hive.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>&#8220;Hey! Have you heard the news?&#8221; they cried.
&#8220;Only a pair of shoes came back from the city last
night instead of the inn-keeper.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the talk of the village that morning, and
the amount of gossip was sinful!</p>

<p>When Yankel&#8217;s widow had a pair of shoes returned
to her instead of her husband, she lost her
head entirely and didn&#8217;t know what in the world
to do. To make matters worse, Yankel had wisely
taken all his bonds to town with him, never dreaming
that Khapun would get him that night. How could
the poor Jew guess that out of the whole Hebrew congregation
the devil would happen to choose him?</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way people always are, they never
know, they never feel when trouble like, for instance,
Khapun is hanging over their heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>So spoke the village folk, shaking their heads as
they left the inn where the young Jewess and her
children were tearing their clothes and beating their
foreheads on the floor. And at the same time each
man thought to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyhow, the bond I gave him has gone to
the devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>To tell you the truth, there were very few in the
village whose consciences whispered to them:</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be a bad idea to return the principal
to the Jews, even if we kept the interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the fact is no one gave up so much as one
crooked penny.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>The miller did not pay anything either, but then
he thought he was different.</p>

<p>The widow Yankel begged and implored the townsfolk
to help her, and even made her children throw
themselves at their feet, beseeching them to let her
have fifty, or even twenty, copecks on every rouble
so that she shouldn&#8217;t starve, and might somehow
manage to take her little orphans to the city. And
more than one kind-hearted man was so moved that
the tears trickled down his whiskers, and more than
one nudged his neighbour and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you any fear of God in you, neighbour?
Didn&#8217;t you owe the Jew money? Why don&#8217;t
you pay her? Upon my word, you ought to, even
if it&#8217;s only a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the neighbour would only scratch his top-knot
under his hat and answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I pay him, when with my own hands
I took him every penny I owed him the day he went
to the city? Would you have me to pay twice? Now
with you, neighbour, it&#8217;s different!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is it different with me when I did exactly
what you did? Yankel came to me just before he
went away and begged me to pay him, and I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>The miller listened to all this, and his heart ached
to hear it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a bad lot they are!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Goodness
knows, they&#8217;re a bad lot! There&#8217;s absolutely no
fear of God in their hearts. I see from this that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
they&#8217;ll never pay me unless they&#8217;re driven to do it.
So, gentlemen, I must take care or I shall get robbed;
only a born fool would put his finger in the mouth
of any one of you! No, you needn&#8217;t expect that
of me! I&#8217;m not going to make a fool of myself.
You&#8217;ll not spit in my porridge. If anything, I&#8217;ll
spit in yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Prisia alone took the Jewess two dozen eggs
and a piece of cloth, and paid the inn-keeper&#8217;s
widow as many copecks as she owed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take them, dearie, in God&#8217;s name,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;If I owe you a little more I&#8217;ll bring it here as God
sends it to me. I have brought you all I have now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a crafty old woman for you!&#8221; the miller
again commented angrily. &#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t pay me
a thing yesterday and yet she is able to pay the
Jewess. How wicked these people are! One can&#8217;t
even trust the old women. She says she can&#8217;t pay a
good Christian like me and then goes and hands over
all her money to a nasty Jewess. Wait a bit, old
woman, I&#8217;ll get even with you some day!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, Yankel&#8217;s widow gathered her children about
her, and sold the inn and the stock of vodka for a
song; but there wasn&#8217;t much vodka left, for Yankel
had meant to bring back a cask from the city, and
people said, too, that Kharko had filched a cask or
two from what had remained. So she took what she
could get and left Novokamensk on foot with her children.
Two she carried in her arms, a third toddled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
at her side holding on to her skirt, and the two
eldest skipped on ahead.</p>

<p>And again the villagers scratched their heads,
while those who had a conscience thought: &#8220;If only
I could give the Jewess a wagon for the money I owe
her perhaps I&#8217;d feel easier.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, you see, each man was afraid that the others
would guess he hadn&#8217;t squared his account with the
Jew.</p>

<p>And the miller thought again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what wicked people! Now I know how gladly
they&#8217;d hustle me out of the way if I should ever
stumble or come a cropper.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the poor widow crawled away to the city, and
heaven only knows what became of her there. Maybe
she and the children found something to do; maybe
they all died of hunger. Everything is possible. But
as a matter of fact, Jews are tenacious creatures.
They may live badly, but they manage to stay alive.</p>

<p>Then the people began to ask themselves who
would be the next inn-keeper in Novokamensk. For
though Yankel had gone and the women and children
of the inn had wandered away into the wide
world, the tavern still stood on its hill, and on its
doors were still depicted in white paint a quart
measure and a tin mug. And everything else was
there in its proper place.</p>

<p>Even Kharko still sat on the hill smoking his long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
pipe and waiting to see whom God would send him
for a master.</p>

<p>One evening though, when the village folk were
standing in front of the empty tavern and wondering
who would be their next inn-keeper, the priest
came up, and bowing deeply&mdash;for the mayor was
there, and as he is a great man it is no sin even for
a priest to bow to him&mdash;began to say what a good
thing it would be if a meeting could be arranged
to close up the tavern for good and all. He, the
priest, would write a letter with his own hand and
send it to the bishop. And this would be a splendid,
beautiful thing, and beneficial to the whole village.</p>

<p>The old men and the women answered that what
the priest had said was the honest truth, but the
miller thought the priest&#8217;s idea absolutely worthless
and even insulting.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a wicked priest!&#8221; he thought with indignation.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a friend for you! Just you wait
a bit, though, holy Father, you&#8217;ll see what&#8217;ll happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right, Father,&#8221; he answered in oily
tones, &#8220;your letter will do a great deal of good,
only I don&#8217;t know whom it will help most, you or
the village. You know yourself&mdash;don&#8217;t take it ill&mdash;that
you always send to the city for vodka and so
you don&#8217;t need the tavern. It would be very nice
for you to have the bishop read your letter and praise
it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>The people shouted with laughter, but the priest
only spat in a great huff, clapped his straw hat on
his head, and walked away down the street as if nothing
had happened and he was simply taking an evening
stroll.</p>

<p>Need I tell you more? You must surely have
guessed already that the miller had made up his
mind to be the keeper of the Jewish tavern. And
having made up his mind he talked very agreeably
to the mayor, entertained whichever members of
the County Court he thought advisable, and reasoned
very cleverly with the captain of police and with the
head of the District, as well as with the judge, the
treasurer, and finally with the commissioner of rural
police and the customs inspector.</p>

<p>On his way back from the village after all these
exertions the miller passed the inn. There was Kharko,
sitting on the hill smoking his pipe. The miller
only nodded to him, but Kharko&mdash;although he was
a proud fellow&mdash;jumped up at once and ran toward
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what have you got to say?&#8221; asked the
miller.</p>

<p>&#8220;What should I have to say? I am waiting for
you to tell me something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kharko didn&#8217;t want to nail the miller down with
words yet, so he listened to what the miller said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
pulled off his cap with both hands, and wisely answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be very glad to do all I can for my kind
master.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the miller took possession of the inn and lorded
it in Novokamensk better than Yankel had done. He
put his roubles out to pasture among the people,
and when the time came he drove them and their
increase back into his chest. And no one there was
to get in his way.</p>

<p>And if it was true that more than one person wept
bitter tears because of him&mdash;why there is no room
for truth in this world. And many did weep; whether
more than had wept when Yankel kept the inn or
fewer, I cannot attempt to say. Who can take the
measure of human grief and who can count human
tears?</p>

<p>Ah, no one has ever measured the grief and no
one has ever counted the tears of the world, but the
old folks say, &#8220;walking or riding, trouble&#8217;s always in
hiding&#8221;; and that &#8220;the back doesn&#8217;t laugh at a stick
or a staff.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know how true that is, but it
seems true to me.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>I must admit I didn&#8217;t mean to tell you all this
about my friend, but it&#8217;s too late to take it back
now. I&#8217;ve begun the story and I shall go on to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
the end. A song&#8217;s not a song, they say, if a word is
missing. And after all, if the miller doesn&#8217;t hide anything,
why should I?</p>

<p>You see, the state of affairs was this. All old
Yankel had ever wanted had been human money.
If he heard with one corner of his ear that some
one had a rouble or two loose in his pocket his
heart would give him a little prod and he would
immediately think of some way in which he could
pull up that rouble and put it to work for him, as one
might pull a fish out of somebody else&#8217;s pond. If he
succeeded, he and his Sarah would rejoice over their
good fortune.</p>

<p>But that wasn&#8217;t enough for the miller. Yankel
had always grovelled before every one, but the miller
held his head as high as a turkey cock. Yankel
had always slipped up to the back door of the District
policeman&#8217;s house and stood timidly on the
threshold, but the miller swaggered all over the front
steps as if he were at home there. Yankel never
took it hard if he got his ears boxed by some
drunken fellow. He howled a bit and then stopped,
perhaps squeezing a few extra copecks out of his tormentor
one day or another to make up for it. But
if the miller ever got hold of a peasant&#8217;s top-knot it
would probably stay in his hands, and his eyes would
flash like the sparks from a blacksmith&#8217;s hammer.
With the miller it was: pay up both money and respect!
And he got them both, there&#8217;s no use denying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
it. The people bowed low before their icons, but they
bowed lower before my friend.</p>

<p>And yet he never could get enough. He went about
as surly and angry as if a puppy were worrying
his heart, thinking to himself all the time:</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is wrong in this world, everything is
wrong! Somehow money doesn&#8217;t make a man as
happy as it ought to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kharko once asked him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you go about looking as cross as if some
one had thrown a bucket of slops over you, master?
What does my master want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps if I got married I should be happier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then go ahead and get married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the trouble. How can I get married
when the thing&#8217;s impossible no matter how I tackle
it? I&#8217;ll tell you the truth: I fell in love with Galya,
the widow&#8217;s daughter, before I ever came to be a
miller and while I was still a workman at the mill.
If my uncle hadn&#8217;t got drowned I should be married
to her to-day. But now you see yourself that she is
below me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, she is below you! All you can do now
is to marry rich old Makogon&#8217;s daughter Motria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are! I can see for myself and every
one says that my money and old Makogon&#8217;s would
just match, but there you are again&mdash;the girl is so
ugly. She sits all day like a great bale of hay everlastingly
hulling seeds. Every time I look at her I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
feel as if some one had got me by the nose and were
pulling me away from her. How different Galya is!
That&#8217;s why I say everything is wrong in this world.
If a man loves one girl the other one&#8217;s sure to have
the money. I shall certainly shrivel up some day like
a blade of grass. I loathe the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier took his pipe out of his mouth, spat,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bad! Any one but me would never have
thought of a way out of it, but I&#8217;m going to give
you some advice that you&#8217;ll not be sorry if you take.
Will you give me the pair of new boots that Opanas
left in pawn if I tell you what to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t begrudge you a pair of boots for
your advice, but have you thought of something
that really will help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, it turned out that that wicked soldier had
thought of a plan which, if it had gone through a
little bit sooner, would certainly have sent the miller
straight to the devil in hell and I should never have
been telling you this story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then, listen carefully to me,&#8221; Kharko
said. &#8220;Plainly, there are three of you, one man and
two girls. And plainly one man can&#8217;t possibly marry
them both unless he&#8217;s a Turk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How right the wretch is!&#8221; thought the miller.
&#8220;What&#8217;s coming next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Now as you are a rich man and Motria<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
is a rich girl, and baby can see who ought to marry
who. Send the match-makers to old Makogon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well! I knew that without being
told. But what about Galya?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to hear to the end? Or do you
yourself know what I&#8217;m going to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, don&#8217;t get cross!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make every one cross. I&#8217;m not the man to
begin saying something and then stop before I&#8217;ve
finished. Now, to come to Galya. Used she to love
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say she did!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what were you when she loved you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A workman in the mill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then a baby could understand that too. If the
girl loved a workman once, let her marry a workman
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The miller&#8217;s eyes grew as round as saucers and
his head began to go round like a mill-wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not a workman any longer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dreadful! And isn&#8217;t there a workman at
the mill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean Gavrilo? So that&#8217;s your idea, is it?
Very well, let him give you a pair of boots for it!
Neither he nor his uncle nor his aunts will ever see
me stand that arrangement, I can tell you! I&#8217;d
sooner go and break every bone in his body.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious, what a hot-tempered fellow you are;
hot enough to boil an egg! I was going to tell you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
something entirely different when you boiled over
like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can you tell me now seeing that that little
joke didn&#8217;t please me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kharko took his pipe out of his mouth, winked,
and clicked his tongue so sympathetically the miller
felt better at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&mdash;did you love her though she was
poor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed I did!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, go on loving her to your heart&#8217;s content
after she has married the workman. And this
is the end of my speech. You three will live at the
mill together and the fourth fool won&#8217;t count. Aha!
Now you know whether I have brought you honey
or gall, don&#8217;t you? Yes indeed! Kharko&#8217;s head
is all right because he was always licked on the
back. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s such a clever fellow and
knows who will get the kernel of the nut, who will
get the shell, and who will get the pair of boots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what if your plan shouldn&#8217;t work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t it work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For lots of reasons. Perhaps old Makogon won&#8217;t
consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! Let me talk to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what would you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you. I&#8217;d be on my way from the city with
a load of vodka. He&#8217;d be coming toward me. We&#8217;d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
talk a while and then I&#8217;d say: I&#8217;ve found a husband
for your daughter; it&#8217;s our miller.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what would he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d say: &#8216;Well I never! Your grandmother
never expected that! How much is he worth?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what would you answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d answer: Of course my grandmother never expected
it because she died long ago, God rest her
soul! So you don&#8217;t know, I see, that the devil has
carried away our Jew?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then that&#8217;s altogether different,&#8217; he&#8217;d say. &#8216;If
there&#8217;s no Jew in the village the miller will be a substantial
man.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, supposing Makogon gives his consent,
will Galya marry the workman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you drive the girl and her mother out of their
khata she will be glad to live at the mill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see&mdash;well, well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The miller scratched his head in perplexity, and
things went on like that, you must know, not only
for a day but for almost a year. The miller had
hardly had time to look about him before St. Philip&#8217;s
day had come and gone, and Easter, and Spring, and
Summer. Then once again he found himself standing
at the door of the tavern, with Kharko leaning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
against the door post beside him. The moon was
shining exactly as it had shone one year before,
the river was sparkling as it had sparkled then, the
street was just as white, and the same black shadow
was lying on the silver ground beside the miller.
And something flashed across his memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me, Kharko!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What day of the week is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Saturday last year, do you remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saturdays are as thick as flies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean the Day of Atonement one year ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re thinking of! Yes, it was
Saturday last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When will the Day of Atonement be this year?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say when it will be. There&#8217;s no Jew near
here now, so I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at the sky. It&#8217;s clear and bright, just as
it was that night.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the miller glanced in terror at the window
of the Jewish hut, afraid of seeing again those
Hebrew children nodding their heads and humming
their prayers for their daddy whom Khapun was
carrying away over the hills and dales.</p>

<p>But no! All that was over. Probably not a
bone was left of Yankel by now; his orphans had
wandered away into the wide world, and their hut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
was as dark as a tomb. The miller&#8217;s heart was as
full of darkness as the deserted Jewish khata.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t save the Jew,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;It was I
who made his children orphans, and now what dreadful
things am I plotting against the widow&#8217;s daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it be right for us to do it?&#8221; he asked of
Kharko.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? Of course there are some people who
won&#8217;t eat honey. Perhaps you are one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not one of them, but still&mdash;well, good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>The miller started down the hill, and once more
Kharko whistled after him. Although he did not
whistle as insultingly as he had the year before, it
flicked the miller on the raw.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by whistling, you rascal?&#8221;
he asked, turning round.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, mayn&#8217;t a man even whistle?&#8221; Kharko retorted
crossly. &#8220;I used to whistle when I was orderly
to the Captain, and yet I mayn&#8217;t do it here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, why shouldn&#8217;t he whistle?&#8221; the miller
thought. &#8220;Only why does everything happen just
as it did that evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>So he walked away down the hill and Kharko
went on whistling, only more softly. The miller
passed the garden where the cherry trees grew, and
once more what seemed to be two great birds rose out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
of the grass. Once more a tall hat and a girl&#8217;s white
blouse gleamed in the darkness and some one gave a
smack that resounded through the bushes. Ugh, out
upon you! But this time the miller did not stop to
scold the shameless youngster; he was afraid he
might get the very same answer he had had the year
before. So our Philip went his way quietly toward
the widow&#8217;s cottage.</p>

<p>There stood the little khata shimmering under the
moon; the tiny window was winking, and the tall
poplar seemed to be bathing in the moonlight. The
miller stopped at the stile, scratched his head under
his hat, and again threw his leg across the hedge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Knock&mdash;knock!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Okh, there is sure to be a fuss as there was last
time, only worse,&#8221; thought the miller. &#8220;That infernal
Kharko with his infernal talk told me just what
to say, but now, when I remember what he told me,
it doesn&#8217;t somehow seem right. It doesn&#8217;t sound
common sense. But what will be, will be!&#8221; and he
knocked again.</p>

<p>A pale face and a pair of black eyes gleamed for
an instant at the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, mother mine!&#8221; whispered Galya. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
that wicked miller again standing at the window
and tapping on the pane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, she doesn&#8217;t lean out to put her arms around
me and kiss me this time, even by mistake,&#8221; thought
the miller sadly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>The girl came out softly and stood a long way
off with her arms folded on her white breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by knocking again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alas, it is bitter for a man to hear such cold
words from the girl who has been his darling love!
The miller longed to embrace her girlish form and
show her why he had knocked. To tell you the truth,
he was already beginning to sidle toward her when
he remembered what Kharko had told him, and answered
instead:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I not knock when you owe me so
much that you will never be able to pay me? Your
hut isn&#8217;t worth the debt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you know we shall never pay you, don&#8217;t come
knocking at the window by night, you godless man!
You will drive my old mother into her grave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who the devil is driving her into her grave,
Galya? If you only would let me, I would give
your mother a peaceful old age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lying!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not lying! Oi, Galya, Galya! I can&#8217;t
live without loving you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You lie like a dog! Who was it sent the match-makers
to Makogon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether I sent them or not, I&#8217;ll tell you the
whole truth and swear to it if you like. I&#8217;m pining
and fading away without you. And I&#8217;m going to
tell you just what we&#8217;ll do, and if you&#8217;re a sensible
girl you&#8217;ll listen to me. But I make one condition:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
listen with your ears and answer with your
tongue. No hand play this time! If there is, I&#8217;ll
be angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve a funny way of doing things,&#8221; said Galya,
folding her arms. &#8220;However, I&#8217;ll listen to you; but
I warn you, if you begin to talk nonsense don&#8217;t call
on your God to help you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be nonsense. You see&mdash;oh, how did
Kharko begin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kharko? What has Kharko to do with you and
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do be quiet or I won&#8217;t be able to get anything
straight. Listen to me: used you to love
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would I have kissed an ugly face like yours if
I hadn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what was I then, a workman in the mill
or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A workman, of course. I wish to goodness you
had never become a miller!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut, don&#8217;t talk so much or I&#8217;ll get mixed
up! So you see it is clear that you loved a workman
once and that therefore you ought to marry a
workman now and live at the mill. And I shall go
on loving you as I always have, even if I marry ten
Motrias.&#8221;</p>

<p>Galya actually rubbed her eyes; she thought she
was dreaming.</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense are you talking, man? Either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
I&#8217;m absolutely crazy or else there&#8217;s a screw loose
in your head. How can I marry a workman now
that you are a miller? And how can you marry me
when you&#8217;re sending the match-makers to Motria?
What nonsense you&#8217;re talking, man! Cross yourself
with your left hand!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; answered the miller. &#8220;Do
you think I haven&#8217;t a workman at the mill? What
about Gavrilo? Isn&#8217;t he one? He&#8217;s a little stupid,
I know, but that will be all the better for us, Galya,
my darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Only then did the girl at last understand what
the miller was driving at with his cunning talk. You
should have seen her throw up her arms and heard
her scream!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, mother, dear mother, listen to what he is saying!
He wants to turn Turk and to keep two wives!
Fetch the pitchfork out of the cottage quick, while
I settle him with my hands!&#8221;</p>

<p>So she fell upon the miller, and the miller fell
back. He escaped to the stile, put one foot upon
it, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho! So that&#8217;s your game, little viper! Very
well then, quit this hut with your mother! To-morrow
I&#8217;ll take it for your debts. Away with
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>But she shouted back:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of my garden, you Turk, as long as
it&#8217;s mine! If you don&#8217;t I&#8217;ll scratch you with my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
nails so that even your Motria won&#8217;t know where
your eyes and nose and mouth have been. Not only
will you not have two sweethearts, not one will
look at an eyeless creature like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>What use to talk to her? The miller spat, jumped
quickly over the hedge, and left the village in a rage.
When he reached the crest of the hill from where
there came to him the murmuring of the stream
in the mill-race, he looked back and shook his fist.</p>

<p>And at that moment he heard the sound of a bell:
ding, dong; ding, dong! Again Kadilo was ringing
the hour of midnight from the village belfry.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>The miller reached his mill. It was all drenched
with dew; the moon was shining, the wood was shimmering,
and a bittern, that foul bird, was awake
and booming in the reeds, sleepless, as if it were waiting
for some one, as if it were calling up some one out
of the pond.</p>

<p>Dread fell upon Philip the miller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey! Gavrilo!&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oo-oo, oo-oo!&#8221; answered the bittern from the
marsh, but not a squeak came from the mill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the confounded scapegrace! He&#8217;s run off
after the girls again.&#8221; So thought the miller, and
somehow did not feel like going alone into the empty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
mill. Although he was used to it, he sometimes remembered
that not only fish but adders were to be
found swimming about among the piles in the dark
water under the floor.</p>

<p>He looked in the direction of the city. The night
was warm and bright; a light mist was circling over
the river that flowed through the woods, lost in
the shimmering murk. There was not a cloud in
the sky.</p>

<p>The miller looked behind him, and wondered
afresh at the depth of his pond that found room
in its bosom for the moon and the stars and the
whole of the dark blue sky.</p>

<p>As he gazed at the pond, he saw in the water something
resembling a gnat flying across the stars. He
looked more closely, and saw the gnat grow to the
size of a fly, and the fly to a sparrow, and the sparrow
to a crow, and the crow to a hawk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be damned!&#8221; cried the miller, and, raising
his eyes, he saw something flying not through
the water but through the air, and making straight
for the mill.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord preserve us! There&#8217;s Khapun again
hurrying to the city after his prey. Look at him,
the unholy brute, how late he is this time! It&#8217;s past
midnight already, and he&#8217;s just starting out.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the miller was standing there staring up
at the sky, the cloud, which was now as large as an
eagle, circled over the mill and began to descend.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
Out of it came a humming sound like out of a huge
swarm of bees that has left its hive and is hovering
over a garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Is he going to rest on my dam again?&#8221;
thought the miller. &#8220;What a habit he makes of it
now! Wait a bit, mister! I&#8217;ll put up a cross there
next year, and then you won&#8217;t come stopping at my
dam on your journey like a gentleman at an inn.
But what is he making that noise for, like those
rattling kites children fly? I must hide under the
sycamores again, and see what he&#8217;s going to do
next.&#8221;</p>

<p>But before he had had time to reach the trees,
the miller looked up and nearly shrieked aloud with
terror. He saw his guest hovering right over the
mill holding&mdash;what? You will never guess what the
devil held in his clutches.</p>

<p>It was Yankel the Jew! Yes, he had brought back
the selfsame Yankel whom he had carried away the
year before. He was holding him tight by the back,
and in Yankel&#8217;s hands was a huge bundle tied up in
a sheet. The devil and Yankel were abusing one
another in the air, and making as much fuss as ten
Jews in a bazaar squabbling over one peasant.</p>

<p>The devil dropped on to the dam like a stone.
If it hadn&#8217;t been for his soft bundle every bone in
Yankel&#8217;s body would certainly have been broken to
pieces. As soon as they touched the ground both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
jumped to their feet and went at it again, hammer
and tongs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, oi! What a dirty, foul trick!&#8221; screamed
Yankel. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you have let me down more
gently? I suppose you knew you had a living man
in your claws?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you and your bundle had gone right
through the earth!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! What harm does my little bundle do you?
You don&#8217;t have to carry it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your <i>little</i> bundle indeed! A whole mountain of
trash! I have only just managed to drag you
back. Oo-ff! There was nothing about this in our
contract.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But when has it ever been known that a man went
on a journey without any baggage? If you carry
a man you must carry his things too; that&#8217;s understood
without any contract. I see! You&#8217;ve been
trying to cheat poor Yankel the Jew from the very
start, and that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re quarrelling now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Any one who tried to cheat you, you old
fox, wouldn&#8217;t live three days! I&#8217;m precious sorry
I ever agreed to anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you think I am perfectly delighted to
have made your acquaintance? Oi, vei! You&#8217;d better
tell me yourself what our contract was. But
you may have forgotten it, so I&#8217;ll remind you. We
made a bet. Perhaps you will say we didn&#8217;t make
a bet? That would be a nice trick!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>&#8220;Who said we didn&#8217;t make a bet? Did I say we
didn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how could you say we didn&#8217;t, when we made it
right here in this very place? Perhaps you don&#8217;t
remember what the bet was, as I do. You said: Jews
are usurers, Jews sell the people vodka, Jews have
pity on their own people but on no one else; that&#8217;s
why every one wishes them to the devil. Of course,
perhaps you didn&#8217;t say that, and perhaps I didn&#8217;t
say in answer: there stands a miller behind that
very sycamore tree who, if he had any pity for
Jews, would shout to you now and say: &#8216;Drop him,
Mr. Devil; he has a wife, he has children!&#8217; But he
won&#8217;t do it. That was number one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could the wretch have guessed that?&#8221;
thought the miller; but the devil said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; number one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then I said&mdash;don&#8217;t you remember?&mdash;I said:
as soon as I&#8217;ve gone the miller will open a tavern
and will begin selling diluted vodka. He lends money
already at a fine rate of interest. That was number
two!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; number two!&#8221; the devil agreed, but
the miller scratched his head and thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;How could the infernal brute have guessed all
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I went on to say that, as a matter of fact,
Christians did wish us to the devil. But do you
think, said I, that if one of us Jews were here now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
and saw what you want to do to me he wouldn&#8217;t
raise a fine riot? But every one you ask will say of
the miller in a year: the devil fly away with him!
That was number three!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; number three. I don&#8217;t deny it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a fine business it would be if you did deny
it! What sort of an honest Hebrew devil would
you be after that? Tell me now what you agreed
to do on your part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done all I agreed. I have left you alive
for a year; number one. I have brought you back
here; number two&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what about number three? What are you
going to do about that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think I&#8217;m going to do? If you
win the bet I&#8217;ll let you go scot free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And my losses? Don&#8217;t you know that you owe
me for my losses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Losses? What losses can you have had when
we allowed you to do business with us for a
whole year without paying a license? You wouldn&#8217;t
have made as much profit in three years on earth.
Just think for yourself: I carried you off in your
shirt without even a pair of shoes to your feet, and
look what a big bundle you&#8217;ve brought back! Where
did you get it from if you made nothing but losses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, vei! There you are scolding me about my
bundle again! Whatever I made there by trading
is my own business. Did you count my profits?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
I tell you I made nothing but losses out of my
dealings with you, besides losing a year here on
earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you swindler you!&#8221; shouted the devil.</p>

<p>&#8220;I a swindler? No, you&#8217;re a swindler yourself, you
thief, you liar, you scab!&#8221;</p>

<p>And they began again to wrangle so violently
that their words became quite unintelligible.
They waved their arms, their skull-caps quivered,
and they stood up on tip-toe like two cocks preparing
to fight. The devil was the first to regain
control of himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we don&#8217;t yet know who has won the bet! It
is true that the miller didn&#8217;t take pity on you, but
we haven&#8217;t decided the other points yet. We haven&#8217;t
asked the people whether he opened a tavern or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have opened two!&#8221; the miller thought, scratching
his head again. &#8220;Oh, why didn&#8217;t I wait a year?
Then Yankel would have been sent to the devil for
good, but now something disagreeable may come of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked round at his mill. Couldn&#8217;t he possibly
slip away to the village by crawling behind
it? But just as he was contemplating this move,
the sound of muttering and of uncertain footsteps
came to his ears from the wood. Yankel threw
his bundle over his shoulder, and ran to the very
sycamore tree where the miller was hiding. The
miller hardly had time to slip behind a big willow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
tree before the devil and Yankel were both under
the sycamore, and at that moment Gavrilo appeared
at the far end of the dam. Gavrilo&#8217;s coat was in
tatters and was hanging off one shoulder; his hat
was on one side of his head, and his bare feet were
continually quarrelling with one another. If one
wanted to go to the right, the other, out of contrariness,
tried to go to the left. One pulled one
way and the other the other, until the poor man&#8217;s
head and feet nearly flew off in opposite directions.
So the poor lad staggered along, weaving patterns
all across the dam from one side to the other, but
not progressing forward very fast.</p>

<p>The devil saw that Gavrilo was full, so he came
out and stood in the middle of the dam just as he
was. Why the devil need any one stand on ceremony
with a drunkard?</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, good fellow!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Where
did you get so full?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he said this, the miller noticed for the first time
how miserable and ragged Gavrilo had grown during
the last year. And it was all because he drank
up at his master&#8217;s tavern everything that he earned
from his master. It was long since he had seen any
money; he took it all out in vodka.</p>

<p>The workman walked right up to the devil, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa there! What has come over these devilish
feet of mine? When I want them to walk, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
stop; when they see any one standing under my very
nose, they rush on ahead. Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With your permission, I am the devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wha-at? I believe you&#8217;re lying. Well, I never!
But perhaps you are right after all! There are your
horns and your tail, just as they ought to be. But
why do you wear ringlets hanging down your
cheeks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To tell you the truth, I&#8217;m the Hebrew devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha! There&#8217;s a marvel for you! If I were to
tell people I had seen your honour no one would believe
me. Wasn&#8217;t it you who carried off our Yankel
last year?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And whom are you after now? Not me? If
you are, I swear I&#8217;ll yell. Yes, I&#8217;ll yell like mad.
You don&#8217;t know what a voice I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, don&#8217;t scream for nothing, good fellow.
What good would you be to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then perhaps it&#8217;s the miller you want? If you&#8217;d
like me to call him, I will. But no, wait a bit. Who
would be our inn-keeper if you took him away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he keep an inn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he? He keeps two: one in the village and
one by the side of the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! ha! ha! And is that why you would be
sorry to lose the miller?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, what a loud laugh you have! Ha! I&#8217;m not
the fellow to be sorry on the miller&#8217;s account. No, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
didn&#8217;t mean that at all. He&#8217;s not a man to be sorry
for. He thinks poor Gavrilo&#8217;s a fool. And he&#8217;s
right too. I&#8217;m not very clever&mdash;don&#8217;t think ill of
me for it&mdash;but still, when I eat I don&#8217;t put my porridge
in another man&#8217;s mouth, but into my own. And
if I get married it will be for myself, and if I don&#8217;t
get married it will be for myself too. Am I right or
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, you&#8217;re right, but I don&#8217;t yet know
what you&#8217;re driving at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hee, hee, perhaps you don&#8217;t know because you
don&#8217;t need to. But I need to know, and I do know
why he wants to get me married. Oi, I know it very
well, even though I&#8217;m not very bright. When you
carried Yankel away that time I was sorry to see him
go, and I said to my master: Well, who is going
to keep the inn for us now? And he answered:
Bah, you fool, do you think some one won&#8217;t turn up?
Perhaps I&#8217;ll keep it myself! That&#8217;s why I say
now: take the miller if you want him; we&#8217;ll find
some one else to be a Jew in his place. And now
let me tell you, my good man&mdash;good gracious, your
honour, don&#8217;t think ill of me for calling a foul fiend
a man!&mdash;and now let me tell you something: I&#8217;m getting
terribly sleepy. Do as you please, but catch
him yourself; I&#8217;m going to bed, I am, because I&#8217;m not
very well. That will be splendid. Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gavrilo&#8217;s legs began weaving again, and he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
hardly opened the door of the mill before he fell
down and began to snore.</p>

<p>The devil laughed merrily, and, going to the edge
of the dam, beckoned to Yankel where he stood under
the sycamore tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to have won, Yankel,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;It
looks very much like it. But give me something to
wear, all the same; I&#8217;ll pay you for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yankel took a pair of breeches to the light and
looked them over to be sure he wasn&#8217;t giving the
devil a new pair, and while he was busy with them,
an ox-cart appeared on the road leading out of
the wood. The oxen were sleepily nodding their
heads, the wheels were quietly squeaking, and in the
cart lay a peasant, Opanas the Slow, without a coat,
without a hat, without boots, bawling a song at the
top of his voice.</p>

<p>Opanas was a good peasant, but the poor fellow
sorely loved vodka. Whenever he dressed up to go
anywhere Kharko would be sure to call to him from
his look-out at the inn-door:</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you drink a little mugful, Opanas? What&#8217;s
your hurry?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Opanas would drink it.</p>

<p>Then, when he had crossed the dam and reached
the village, the miller himself would call to him from
the door of the other tavern:</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in and have a little mugful,
Opanas? What&#8217;s the hurry?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>And Opanas would have another drink there.
First thing you knew he would turn home without
having been anywhere else at all.</p>

<p>Yes, he was a good peasant, but fate had ordained
him always to fall between the two taverns. And yet
he was a merry fellow and was always singing
songs. That is man&#8217;s nature. When he has drunk
up everything he possesses and knows that an angry
wife is waiting for him at home, he will make up a
song and think he has got rid of his troubles.
And so it was with Opanas. He was lying in his
wagon singing so loudly that even the frogs jumped
into the water as he drove up, and this was his song:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, what is that devilish brute standing right in
the middle of the dam for, keeping my oxen from
crossing? If I wasn&#8217;t too tired to get out of the
cart, I&#8217;d show him how to plant himself there in the
middle of the road. Gee, gee, gee-up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop a minute, my good man!&#8221; said the devil
very sweetly. &#8220;I want to have a minute&#8217;s talk with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A minute&#8217;s talk? All right then, talk away, only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
I&#8217;m in a hurry. The tavern at Novokamensk will
soon be closed so that no one can get in. But I
don&#8217;t know what you want to talk about; I don&#8217;t
know you. Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About whom were you singing that pretty song?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for praising it! I was singing about
the miller that lives in this mill, but whether the
song was pretty or not is my own affair, because I
was singing it to myself. Perhaps some people
would fly when they heard the song, perhaps some
would cry. Gee, gee, gee-up! What! Are you still
standing there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still standing here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said in your song that the miller&#8217;s vodka is
good. Is that so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha, now I see how sly you are! You begin
quarrelling with a man&#8217;s song before he has sung
it to the end. That&#8217;s the devil&#8217;s own trick! You
don&#8217;t know the proverb, I see: don&#8217;t go to hell before
your father; if you do, you&#8217;ll be sorry. If that&#8217;s
how you feel, I&#8217;d better sing my song to the end, so
here goes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Yes, the vodka in the inn</div>
<div class="verse">Is good as any sold;</div>
<div class="verse">Two parts of it are liquor,</div>
<div class="verse">One is water cold.</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Get out of the way, then! What are you standing
there for? What do you want now? Wait a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
minute till I get out of my wagon and find out
whether you&#8217;re going to stand there much longer!
What would you think if I gave you a taste of my
stick, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going in a minute, my good man, only tell me
one thing more. What would you think if the devil
flew away with your miller here as he flew away with
Yankel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would I think? I wouldn&#8217;t think anything
at all. He&#8217;ll get him some day, that&#8217;s certain; he&#8217;ll
surely get him. But you&#8217;re still standing there, I
see. Take care, I&#8217;m climbing out of my wagon!
Look, I&#8217;ve already raised one leg!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, all right, go along with you if you&#8217;re
as cross as all that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you out of the way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, gee, gee-up!&#8221;</p>

<p>The oxen shook their horns, the yoke and axles
creaked, the wagon trembled, and Opanas continued
his song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Oxen, oxen, how you crawl,</div>
<div class="verse">Hurry up and trot.</div>
<div class="verse">The miller has my coat and wheels,</div>
<div class="verse">So now he has the lot.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The wheels bumped down off the dam, and Opanas&#8217;
song died away behind the hill.</p>

<p>But before it had quite died away another song
rang out from across the river. A ringing chorus of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
women&#8217;s voices came streaming through the night,
first from afar, and then from in the wood. A party
of women and girls, who had been gathering in the
harvest on a distant farm, were now on their way
home late at night, and were singing to give themselves
courage in the wood.</p>

<p>The devil at once slipped to Yankel&#8217;s side under the
willow tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, give me something more to wear, quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yankel handed him a heap of rags. The devil
hurled them to the ground, and seized the bundle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here! What do you mean by giving me these
rags as if I were a beggar? I&#8217;d be ashamed to be
seen in them. Give me something respectable!&#8221;</p>

<p>The devil seized what he wanted, folded his wings,
which were as soft as a bat&#8217;s, in a second, jumped
like a flash into a pair of blue breeches as wide as
the sea, threw on the rest of his clothes, drew his
belt tight, and covered his horns with a high fur
hat. Only his tail hung out over the top of one
boot, and trailed along in the sand like a snake.</p>

<p>Then he smacked his lips, stamped his foot, stuck
his arms akimbo, and went out to meet the lasses,
looking for all the world like any young townsman,
or perhaps some would-be gentleman steward.</p>

<p>He planted himself in the middle of the dam.</p>

<p>The song rang out nearer and nearer and clearer
and clearer, floating away under the bright moon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
until it seemed as if it must wake the whole of the
sleeping world. Then it suddenly broke off short.</p>

<p>The young women poured out of the wood as poppies
might pour out of a girl&#8217;s apron, saw the long-tailed
dandy standing before them, and instantly huddled
together in a group at the farther end of the
dam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that standing there?&#8221; asked one of the
girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the miller,&#8221; answered another.</p>

<p>&#8220;The miller! Why, it doesn&#8217;t look like him one
bit!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s his workman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who ever saw a workman dressed like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us who you are if you&#8217;re not a bad spirit!&#8221;
called the widow Buchilikha, evidently the boldest of
the party.</p>

<p>The devil bowed to them from a distance, and
then approached, cringing and scraping like any
little upstart who tries to appear a gentleman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, my birdies,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;m a
young man, but I won&#8217;t do you any harm. Come on,
and don&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Each trying to push the other ahead, the women
and girls stepped on to the dam, and soon surrounded
the devil. Ah, there is nothing pleasanter than to be
surrounded by a dozen or so frolicsome lasses bombarding
you with swift glances, nudging one another
with their elbows, and giggling. The devil&#8217;s heart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
was beginning to leap and sparkle a little, like birch
bark in a fire; he hardly knew what to do or where to
turn. And the girls kept laughing at him louder
and louder.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s right, little birdies!&#8221; thought
the miller, peering out from behind his gnarled
willow-tree. &#8220;Remember, my duckies, how many
songs Philipko has sung with you, how many dances
he has led! See what trouble I&#8217;m in! Save me; I&#8217;m
caught like a fly in a cobweb!&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought that if only they were to give the devil
one little pinch the fiend would sink into the ground.</p>

<p>But old Buchilikha stopped the girls and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get along with you, little magpies, you&#8217;ve laughed
at the poor lad till his nose hangs down and his
arms are limp. Tell us, young fellow, for whom are
you waiting here at the edge of the pond?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the miller.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re a friend of his?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A plague upon any friend of mine that&#8217;s like
him!&#8221; the miller tried to cry, but his words stuck in
his throat, and the devil replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s no very great friend of mine, but I can call
him an old acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it long since you&#8217;ve seen him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you wouldn&#8217;t recognise him now. He
used to be a nice lad, but he holds his head so high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
now that you couldn&#8217;t touch his nose with a pitchfork.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. It&#8217;s true, isn&#8217;t it, girls?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true, true, true!&#8221; chattered the whole bevy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut, not quite so loud!&#8221; cried the devil, putting
his fingers in his ears. &#8220;Tell me: what has happened
to him, and since when has he changed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since he grew rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And began to lend money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And opened a tavern.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He and his horrid Kharko have fuddled my husband
Opanas so that the poor man never goes anywhere
now except to the tavern.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has ruined our husbands and fathers with
his drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, oi, he&#8217;s a misery to us all, the horrid miller!&#8221;
screamed one of the band, and in place of their songs,
a chorus of wails and women&#8217;s lamentations rang out
across the river.</p>

<p>Philip rather scratched his head to hear the way
the young women were interceding for him. But the
devil&#8217;s mind now seemed to be quite made up. He
glanced at the girls out of one corner of his eye and
rubbed his hands together.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that isn&#8217;t all!&#8221; shouted the widow Buchilikha
louder than the loudest. &#8220;Have you heard what he
wanted to do to the widow&#8217;s Galya?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faugh!&#8221; spat the miller. &#8220;What a damned lot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
of magpies they are! What need to tell what they&#8217;re
not asked about? And how in the world did they
find it out? Though it only happened in the village
to-night, they have heard the whole story in
the hay-fields! Why on earth does God allow women
to live in this world?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did my friend try to do to the widow&#8217;s
daughter?&#8221; asked the devil, looking about him as if
he weren&#8217;t particularly interested in the story.</p>

<p>So the magpies went on to tell him everything,
talking all at once, and laid the whole affair before
him from beginning to end.</p>

<p>The devil shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, oi, oi! That&#8217;s bad, very bad. I don&#8217;t suppose
any one ever heard of your former inn-keeper
Yankel doing anything like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what Jew ever thought of doing such a
thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, never!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see, my daisies, my little peaches, that you
don&#8217;t love my friend very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him get the love of all the devils; he needn&#8217;t
expect any from us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, oi, oi, you don&#8217;t wish him much good, I see!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May the fever take him and shake him to pieces!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May he follow his uncle into the pond!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May the devil carry him off as he carried off
Yankel!&#8221;</p>

<p>They all burst out laughing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>&#8220;You are right, Olena; he is worse than a Jew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least the Jew was a decent fellow; he let the
girls alone and lived with his Sarah.&#8221;</p>

<p>The devil actually jumped in his tracks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, thank you, my birdies, for your
friendly words. Isn&#8217;t it time for you to be going
on?&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he threw back his head like a cock that
intends to give an extra loud crow, and burst into
a fit of uncontrollable laughter. He laughed so
loud that all the evil spirits on the bed of the
river woke up, and circles began spreading across
the surface of the pond. But the girls shied away
from him like a flock of sparrows into which some
one has thrown a stone, and vanished as if the wind
had suddenly blown them off the dam.</p>

<p>The goose-flesh ran up and down the miller&#8217;s back,
and he stared down the road that led to the village.</p>

<p>&#8220;The best thing for me to do,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;is
to make off after those girls as fast as my legs will
carry me. I used to be able to run with the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at that moment he suddenly felt relieved, for
he saw some one coming toward the mill-dam. And it
wasn&#8217;t just any one, either, but his own servant
Kharko.</p>

<p>&#8220;A miss is as good as a mile!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;There
is my man!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<h3>X</h3>


<p>The servant was barefooted; he was wearing a red
shirt; a cap without a brim was stuck on the back
of his head, and on a stick he was carrying Opanas&#8217;
new boots, which were dripping tar all over the dam.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a hurry he&#8217;s in!&#8221; thought the miller. &#8220;He&#8217;s
got hold of the boots already. But never mind, all
my hopes are centred on him now.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as the servant caught sight of a stranger
on the dam he instantly thought that here was some
thieving tramp waiting to steal his boots. So he
stopped a few steps from Khapun and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not come any nearer, I warn you!
I won&#8217;t give them up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you? Come to your
senses, good man! Haven&#8217;t I boots of my own?
Look, they are better than yours!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why have you planted yourself there by
night, like a crooked willow tree by a pond?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, I wanted to ask you a question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid! A riddle is it, eh? Who told you I
could answer riddles better than any one else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha, I&#8217;ve heard people say so!&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier set down his boots, took out his tobacco-pouch,
and began filling his pipe. Then he
struck a light with a flint, and, blowing out a thick
cloud of smoke from under his nose, said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>&#8220;Now, then, spout it out. What&#8217;s your riddle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t exactly a riddle. I wanted to ask you
who you think is the best man in this neighbourhood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why do you think that? Isn&#8217;t there any
one here better than you are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask me what I think. Very well, I answer
that I won&#8217;t give the first place to any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. And the miller, what sort of a man
is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The miller?&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier blew out of his mouth a cloud of smoke
that looked as large in the moonlight as the tail of
a white horse. Then he eyed the devil askance and
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not a Customs officer, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re not in the police&mdash;a detective, by any
chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I tell you! What, a clever chap like
you, and you can&#8217;t even see when a man&#8217;s just an ordinary
fellow and when he isn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who said I couldn&#8217;t? I can see through and
through you. I only asked that on the chance.
And now, let me see; you asked me what sort of
man the miller was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s just about medium height, neither
very large nor very small; a good average.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s not what I wanted to know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it? What more do you want me to tell you?
Perhaps you would like to know where his warts are,
if he has any?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re trying to throw dust in my eyes I see,
but I&#8217;m in a hurry. Tell me in plain words: is the
miller a good man or a bad one?&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier blew another huge tail of smoke out of
his mouth and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a hasty fellow you are! You like to eat,
but you won&#8217;t chew.&#8221;</p>

<p>The devil opened his eyes wide, and the miller&#8217;s
heart jumped for joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a tongue that boy has!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;And
yet how often have I wished that it might drop off.
But now it has come in useful. How he is roasting
the devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You like to eat, but you won&#8217;t chew, I tell you!&#8221;
the soldier repeated sternly. &#8220;You want me to tell
you whether the miller is a good man or not. Every
man&#8217;s good in my opinion. I&#8217;ve eaten bread from
many a stove, friend. I wouldn&#8217;t even cough where
you would die of suffocation. Do you think you&#8217;ve
struck a fool in me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid! Splendid! Give it to him hard!&#8221; the
miller said to himself, dancing with joy. &#8220;My name
isn&#8217;t Philip the miller if the devil doesn&#8217;t look more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
foolish than a sheep before half an hour is over! I
read so fast in church that no one can understand
me, but he talks quietly, and yet just listen to what
he is saying!&#8221;</p>

<p>And in fact the poor devil was scratching his head
so hard that he was nearly knocking his hat off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, soldier!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You and I
seem to run on and on and never get anywhere.
We&#8217;re all tangled up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about you, but there&#8217;s no tangle I
can&#8217;t get out of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But look here; I asked you whether the miller was
a good man or not, and see where you&#8217;ve led me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let me ask you a question: is water good or
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Water? What&#8217;s the matter with water?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if there was kvass<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> about you would turn
up your nose at water, wouldn&#8217;t you? Water would
seem tasteless, then, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, perhaps it would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if there was beer on the table you wouldn&#8217;t
drink kvass, would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, certainly not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if some one brought you a mug of gorelka
you wouldn&#8217;t look at beer, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quite right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well then, you see!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>The devil broke out into a sweat, and the tail
hanging out from under his coat beat the ground
till it actually raised a cloud of dust from the dam.
The soldier threw the stick with his boots on it over
his shoulder and was preparing to take his departure
when the devil thought of a way he might catch him.
He stepped a few steps to one side, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&mdash;go along, go along! I shall wait here a
little while longer in case Kharko the soldier should
happen to come by.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much, but they tell me that Kharko is
a bright fellow and that he knows a thing or two!
I thought at first you were he. But now I see I
was wrong. One simply goes round and round in a
circle with you, and can&#8217;t get going to save one&#8217;s
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier set down his boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, ask me another question!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s the use?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then: tell me, whom did you like the
best, Yankel the inn-keeper, or the miller?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you ask me that at once? I don&#8217;t
like people that hunt for their beards alongside their
noses. Some people would rather walk ten versts
through the fields than go one verst by the straight
road. But I&#8217;ll answer you straight to the point, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
they say. Yankel kept one inn, but the miller keeps
two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hang him, he needn&#8217;t have said that!&#8221; thought
the miller, miserably. &#8220;It would have been ever so
much better if he hadn&#8217;t referred to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the soldier continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;When I worked for Yankel, I wore bast shoes,
now I wear boots!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From where did you get them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From where, eh? Our business is like a well with
two buckets. One bucket fills and the other grows
empty. One goes up and the other goes down. I
used to wear bast shoes; now I wear boots. Opanas
used to wear boots; now he goes barefoot because
he&#8217;s a fool. The bucket comes to the wise man full
and goes away empty. Now do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>The devil listened attentively, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute! At last we seem to be getting
somewhere!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve been telling you the same thing all along.
If you call Yankel kvass, then the miller is beer;
but if you were to give me a glass of good vodka, I
should let the beer alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tip of the devil&#8217;s tail skipped about so madly
on the sand that Kharko noticed it at last. He blew
a puff of smoke right into the devil&#8217;s face, and put
his foot on the tail as if by accident. The devil
jumped, and yelped like a great dog. Both he and
Kharko took fright; they opened their eyes wide,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
and stood for half a minute staring at one another
without saying a word.</p>

<p>At last Kharko whistled in that insolent way of
his, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, ha! ah, ha! So that&#8217;s the game, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did you think?&#8221; asked the devil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I know the kind of a queer bird you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m what you see I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re the one who&mdash;last year&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re&mdash;after him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. And what do you think of my
plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kharko stretched his limbs, blew a puff of smoke,
and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take him! I won&#8217;t cry over him. I&#8217;m a poor
man. It&#8217;s none of my business. I&#8217;ll sit in the inn
smoking my pipe till a third one comes along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the devil roared with laughter, but the
soldier only slung his boots across his back and
walked rapidly away. As he passed the sycamore
tree the miller heard him muttering to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s the game, is it? He&#8217;s carried off one
and now he&#8217;s come back for the other. Well, it&#8217;s
none of my business. When the devil got the Jew
the miller got the goods. Now he&#8217;s come for the
miller and the goods will be mine. A soldier is his
own master. Now that I&#8217;ve the business in my own
hands, let&#8217;s see if I can&#8217;t keep it. I&#8217;ll not be poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
Kharko any longer, but Mr. Khariton Tregubov.
Only I&#8217;m not a fool. No temptation on earth will ever
take me on to this dam at night.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he began climbing the hill.</p>

<p>The miller stared from side to side. Who would
help him now? Not a soul was in sight. Darkness
was falling; a frog was croaking sleepily in the mud;
a bittern was booming angrily in the reeds. The
edge of the moon was peeping over the woods as if
asking: &#8220;What will become of Philip the miller
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>It looked at him, winked, and set behind the trees.</p>

<p>The devil stood on the dam holding his sides with
laughter. His shouts of merriment shook the floury
dust out of every cranny in the old mill; all the
spirits of the forest and pond awoke and came flitting
toward him, some floating like shadows out of the
wood, some hanging like filmy clouds over the water.
The pond stirred, streaks of swirling white vapour
rose from it, and ripples ran in circles across its
surface. The miller gave it one look, and his blood
ran cold: a blue face with dull, staring eyes was glaring
up at him out of the water, its long whiskers
waving like the antenn&aelig; of a water-beetle. Who
could it be but his uncle, rising from the pond and
coming straight toward the sycamore tree?</p>

<p>Yankel the Jew had long since crept silently out
on to the dam, picked up the clothes which the devil
had discarded, slipped across to the sycamore tree,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
and hastily tied up his bundle. There was no more
mention of losses now; any man would have been
afraid to mention them, I can tell you! Losses be
hanged! Yankel hoisted his bundle on to his back
and shuffled quietly away, following the others along
the path that led from the mill to the village.</p>

<p>The miller made a rush for his mill; once there,
at least he would be able to lock himself in or else
wake his workman! But he had hardly quitted his
tree before the devil jumped after him. Philip
dashed into the mill, slammed the door, rushed into
his room, hurriedly lit a light, and fell down on the
floor screaming with might and main, just like&mdash;what
do you think?&mdash;the Jews in their synagogue!</p>

<p>And the devil circled over the mill, stuck his inquisitive
nose in at the window, and couldn&#8217;t make
out how to get at the tempting morsel before him.</p>

<p>Suddenly, bang! Something dropped to the floor
with a thump as if a huge cat had jumped into the
room. That confounded devil had come down the
chimney! The fiend sprang to his feet, and next
instant the miller felt him sitting on his back, digging
his claws into his flesh.</p>

<p>What could he do?</p>

<p>Suddenly, another bang! Darkness fell, and the
devil was dragging the miller through a black, narrow
hole. The miller smelt clay, clouds of soot rose
about him, and all at once he saw lying below him
the chimney and the roof of the mill, growing smaller<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
and smaller every second, as if they and the dam and
the sycamore trees and the pond were falling into a
bottomless pit. And there lay the sky, reflected upside-down
in the calm mill-pond spread out below
them as smooth as a platter, and in it the peaceful
stars were twinkling as they had always twinkled
before. And the miller saw flying across those dark
blue depths a form that looked first like a hawk, and
then like a crow, and then like a sparrow, and then
like a large fly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is taking me ever so high!&#8221; thought the miller.
&#8220;There go your profits for you, Philipko, and your
inns, and all your fine show! Is there no Christian
soul who will call to him: Drop it, it is mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Christian soul there was none! Below him
slept the mill, and out of the pond the monstrous
face of his uncle alone was glaring at him with glassy
eyes, laughing to itself and waving its whiskers.</p>

<p>Farther on the Jew was still crawling up the hill,
stooping under his heavy white bundle. Half way
up the ascent stood Kharko, shading his eyes with
his hand and gazing up at the sky.</p>

<p>The scattered band of girls had overtaken Opanas
and his oxen. They were flying along like lunatics
and Opanas was staring straight up at the sky as
he lay in his cart. Though his heart was kind, his
eyes were blind with vodka, and his tongue was as
heavy as lead. There was no one, no one, who would
cry: Drop it, it is mine!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>And there lay the village. There was the tavern,
closed for the night; there stood the sleeping cottages,
and there lay the gardens. There, too, stood
the tall poplar tree and the widow&#8217;s little khata. Old
Prisia and her daughter were sitting on a bench at
the door, weeping and embracing one another. And
why were they weeping? Was it because next day
the miller was going to drive them out of their native
hut?</p>

<p>The miller&#8217;s heart leaped. At least these two
might give him a kind thought! He plucked up courage
and shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, Galya; don&#8217;t cry, little sweetheart! I&#8217;ll
forgive you all your debts and the interest, too! Oh,
I&#8217;m in trouble, in worse trouble than you are. The
Evil One is carrying me away as a spider carries a
little fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tender and sensitive is the heart of a girl! It
did not seem possible that Galya could have heard
the miller&#8217;s cry from such a great distance, but she
shuddered nevertheless, and raised her dark, weeping
eyes to heaven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell, farewell, my beautiful black eyes,&#8221; the
miller sighed, and at that instant he saw the girl&#8217;s
hands clutch her breast and heard her rend the air
with a piercing scream:</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop it, foul fiend! Drop it, it is mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound tore at the devil&#8217;s ears like the mighty
swing of a brandished chain. His wings fluttered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
feebly, his claws relaxed their hold, and Philip floated
down like a feather, turning from side to side.</p>

<p>The devil dropped after him like a stone. But as
soon as he reached him and grabbed him afresh,
Galya shouted again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop it, accursed one, it is mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>The devil dropped the miller, and once more the
poor man floated downward. So it happened three
times, while the marsh lying between the mill and the
village spread ever wider and wider beneath them.</p>

<p>Splash! The miller fell into the soft mud with
such a bump that the bog bounced as if it had been
on springs, and threw the miller ten feet into the air.
He fell down again, jumped up, and took to his heels
helter-skelter as fast as his legs could carry him.
As he ran he screamed at the top of his lungs, feeling
every second that the devil was going to grab him.</p>

<p>He reached the first hut on the outskirts of the village,
flew the hedge at a bound, and found himself
in the middle of the widow&#8217;s cottage. Here he came
to his senses for the first time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am in your cottage, thank God!&#8221; he said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Just think of it, good people, what a prank he had
played! There he was early in the morning, before
sunrise, before even the cows had been driven out to
pasture, bareheaded, barefooted, in rags, plunging
into the hut of two unmarried women, a widow and
a young girl! Yes, and the fact that he was hatless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
was a small matter; it was lucky indeed he hadn&#8217;t
lost something else on the way; if he had, he would
have disgraced the poor women forever! And on
top of it all what did he say? &#8220;Thank God, I am
in your cottage!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman could only wave her arms, but
Galya jumped up in her nightgown from a bench,
threw on a dress, and cried to the miller:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here, you wicked man? Are
you so drunk that you can&#8217;t find your own hut, and
so come rushing into ours, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the miller stood in front of her looking at her
with gentle if slightly staring eyes, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, hit me as hard as you can!&#8221;</p>

<p>And she hit him once: bang!</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit me again!&#8221;</p>

<p>So she hit him again.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Do you want to hit me any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>So she hit him a third time. Then, when she saw
that not only did he not mind, but stood there looking
at her with gentle eyes, she threw up her hands
and burst into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, misery me, poor orphan that I am, who will
come to my help? Oi, what a man this is! Isn&#8217;t it
enough for him that he has deceived a young girl
like me, and that he wants to turn Turk, and has
made every one gossip about me, and disgraced me
before the whole village? Look at him, look at him,
good people! I have hit him three times and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
won&#8217;t even turn away. Oi, what can I do with a man
like him, tell me, somebody, do!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the miller asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to hit me again or not? Tell me
truly. If you aren&#8217;t, I&#8217;m going to sit down on that
bench, because I&#8217;m tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>Galya&#8217;s hands were approaching the miller again,
but the old woman guessed there was something out
of the ordinary about the business, and said to her
daughter:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a bit, child! Why do you go on slapping
the man&#8217;s neck without even stopping to ask him a
question? Can&#8217;t you see that the lad&#8217;s a little bit
off his head? Tell me, neighbour, where did you come
from so suddenly, and what do you mean by saying:
Thank God I am in your cottage, when you know
you oughtn&#8217;t to be here at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>The miller rubbed his eyes and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me the honest truth, Auntie, am I asleep?
Am I still alive? Has one night or one year passed
since yesterday evening? And did I come here from
the mill or did I drop from the sky?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut, man! Cross yourself with your left
hand! What nonsense you&#8217;re talking. You must
have been dreaming!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, good mother, I don&#8217;t know. I can&#8217;t
make head or tail of it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was about to sit down on a bench, when he
caught sight through the window of Yankel the inn-keeper,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
crawling along with a huge bundle on his
back. The miller jumped up, pointed toward the
window, and asked the two women:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that walking along there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s our Yankel!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is he carrying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bundle from the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why do you say I&#8217;ve been dreaming? Don&#8217;t
you see that the Jew has come back? I saw him at
the mill a moment ago, carrying that very same
bundle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why shouldn&#8217;t he have come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the devil carried him off last year. Khapun,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, in a word, there was a great deal of amazement
when the miller told of all that had happened
to him. And in the meanwhile a crowd was beginning
to collect in the road in front of the cottage;
the people looked in at the window, and began making
slanderous comments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at that!&#8221; they said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a nice state
of affairs! The miller comes tearing across the fields
without a hat, without boots, all ragged and torn,
and runs straight into the widow&#8217;s cottage, and there
he sits with them now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey! Tell us, good man, whom have you come
to see all dressed up like that? Is it Old Prisia, or
young Galya?&#8221;</p>

<p>You will agree, I am sure, that no one can allow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
a poor girl to be gossiped about like that. The miller
was simply obliged to marry her. But Philip has
confessed to me many a time himself that he had
always loved the widow&#8217;s Galya, and that after the
night when she rescued him from the foul fiend&#8217;s
clutches, she grew so dear to him that he wouldn&#8217;t
have let himself be driven away from her with a stick.</p>

<p>They are living at the mill now, and already have
several children. The miller has forgotten his inn
and no longer lends money at interest. And whenever
a voice in his heart whispers to him to wish
Yankel the Jew out of the village to the devil, he
only makes a contemptuous gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the inn?&#8221; He used sometimes to ask people
after his adventure. &#8220;Will it still remain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course the inn will remain. What should
become of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who will keep it? Perhaps you are thinking
of doing it yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, perhaps I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>And at that the miller would only whistle.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>



<p>Yes, that is the adventure that befell the miller.
Such a strange adventure it was that to this day
no one has decided whether it really happened or not.
If you say it was all a falsehood, I can answer that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
the miller was not a man to tell lies. Then, Gavrilo
the workman is still living at the mill, and though
he confesses himself that he was thoroughly drunk
that night, he remembers clearly that the miller
opened the door for him, and that his master&#8217;s face
was whiter than flour. And Yankel came back at
dawn, and Opanas reached home drunk and without
his boots, so it seems as if the miller could not really
have dreamt it after all.</p>

<p>But then, again, take this: how could it be true,
when the whole affair would have taken a year to
happen and yet the miller ran barefoot into Galya&#8217;s
cottage the very next morning? A great many
people actually saw him, and wondered why the
miller was tearing barefoot across the fields to visit
the girl.</p>

<p>The best plan, I think, is not to look too closely
into the story. Whether it happened or whether it
didn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll give you a piece of advice. If you know
a miller, or any man who keeps two taverns and who
abuses the Jews and yet fleeces the people like sheep,
tell your friend this story. I recommend it to you;
the plan has been tried. Whether he gives up his
business or not, he will at least bring you a mugful
of vodka that, for once, won&#8217;t be diluted with water.</p>

<p>There are people, of course, and this too has been
found to be true, who will growl at you like dogs
as soon as you tell them the story. People like them
I answer with these words: Grumble and growl as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
much as you like, but I give you fair warning: take
care the same thing doesn&#8217;t happen to you!</p>

<p>And I say this because, you see, the people of
Novokamensk have more than once seen that very
same devil again. Ever since he has had a taste of
the miller, he doesn&#8217;t want to go home without some
dainty morsel. So he flies about, peering in every direction
like a lost bird.</p>

<p>Therefore, take care, good people, that something
evil doesn&#8217;t befall you.</p>

<p>And now, good-bye! If I haven&#8217;t told the story to
suit your taste, don&#8217;t think ill of me, I&#8217;m only a
plain man.</p>
